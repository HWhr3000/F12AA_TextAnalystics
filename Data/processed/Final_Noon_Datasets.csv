I moved form noon to namshi after it was aquired. \- The son of Mr Al abbar has nothing to do with namshi. he started a company that is called sivvi that was acquired by noon some 4-5 years ago \- Namshi was initially founded by Faraz, Hicham (current CEO and MD of noon) and a few other people backed by Rocket internet (german incubator company). \- Namsih exited by selling its shares slowly slowly to Emaar (which is owned by Mr al Abbar) \- Noon is founded by Mr al abbar and technically has nothing to do with Emaar. they just share Mr al abbar \- Namshi was later sold from emaar to noon. Now on the tech part and reliability issues: \- Namshi and noon share the same login credentials. So if you create a noon account you cna use the same one on namshi \- some of the backend stuff is shared across noon and namshi but not everything \- some tech glitches hence affect both namshi and noon \- there was a glitch a week or so ago that last for a few hours and was on and off which is whtat u/NinjaExorcist is probably referring to \- these downtimes are usually exceptions and in many cases are relevant to external serivices that we use \- in terms of return policy it is pretty open and verry rarely namshi asks any questions when people return things (not sure how long this will last) so make use of it \-refurnd typically happen wihtin 24hours from when the return is picked up \-delivery in UAE can happen in Same day if you order before around 1pm and roughly 98% of deliveries happen within the promissed time. \- in terms of pricing, alot of it is automated and hence you get heavy discounts and in some cases 1% discounts. The heavy discounts are all legit and its usually our liquidation and outlet inventory that we buy in order to discount and get customers \- all products are 100% authentic as we only buy directly on the brands \- some products will be available on both noon and namshi but that doesnt apply to all products.

Tips are mostly done by cash so not recorded by the app. But more importantly tips are how companies like Noon, Talabat and others internationally continue to not pay a fair rate to their drivers. They work on a model of customers subsidising drivers pay so that they can make more money. They want tips to be paid on the app not so that they can take a cut but so that they can quantify how much a driver can make and make it more attractive to drivers when taking the job, perpetuating their pay practises and allowing drivers to get the short end of the stick.

You shouldn't have opened it in the first place and call noon immediately** --- next time on high prices products; start video recording before you open the yellow noon packaging so there is a clear evidence and no switching has been done. I bought a new iphone 15 early this year from noon express at 1k less than the SRP so I immediately assumed I might be scammed. So followed my own advice: > start recording. show the package tracking number to the camera. I opened the yellow packaging and checked the description on the box; all good. checked the serial on the box on the vendor webpage and it exists. I opened the box still while recording (maybe its a brick inside) but it was the real deal. showed the state of the phone to the camera for any dents... all good. turned the phone on. all good. stopped recording.",2,2024-09-21 14:06:51,False,True,comment,dubai

1dmgoup,I was planning to buy Samsung S24 Ultra but the price varies significantly between e-commerce websites and the Samsung online store. Should I be concerned about anything ?,l9wvxns,BoogieWoogieWho,"Don't buy from Noon, unless directly. See numerous complaints on this sub about many sellers their store. If you are going to buy from Amazon, only buy devices ""sold by Amazon.ae"". With promo codes, cash back, and sales, you can get much better deals. Other online sellers (on Noon, Amazon, Carrefour, SharaFDG and others) could repackage the device, reprint the stickers, and hand you a refurbished or open box device. Most people won't be able to tell until they get the device and try to check/verify the IMEI hasn't been activated. &#x200b; Why is buying refurbished or open box a problem? Because you will not be able to buy Samsung Care+ for your devices. Repairs are costly. You should be buying insurance with your new expensive devices. Especially flagships. Plus, if you want to resell it later, these OLED screens get burn-in. You can get the screen replaced and it will bring back some of the lost value of the device when you go to sell it or trade it in. &#x200b; The advantages of buying directly from Samsung are: 1. 60 days to apply for Samsung Care+ as opposed to 30 days. 2. Samsung points. If you upgrade or buy a lot of Samsung devices, these points add up and can be applied to get you better value than typical sales. 3. Better return policy than most physical and online stores (it is on par with Amazon's). Why are prices higher at Samsung's store? 1. To keep margin for the distributors. They don't want to compete with the distributors of their own products, otherwise why would they sell them. The stores are their biggest buyers, not the consumers. Samsung could offer the biggest discounts to consumers if they wanted to compete anyways. 2. To make it seem like their devices are better. Price is part of marketing. Apple has been very good at this and Samsung and other brands follow suit. This is very common in the fashion, makeup, and other luxury industries. Pricing things high makes people think it is premium, exclusive, etc... makes it more desirable and sells more. 3. In reality, these devices probably cost less that 100 AED each to manufacture at the scale they're manufacturing at. The reason they have to be marked up so high is to make up for all the costs that went into making the production at scale. You can't just make 1 S24, you need to make all the components, secure resources, hire skilled people, advertise, market, register, pay for the bureaucracy, etc... &#x200b; What is the difference between UAE and international versions? Can be a few things, relating to electrical stuff, but usually radios. There are many radios on our phones to be able to connect to WiFi and the cell towers. There are many different bands and frequencies. Different countries allocate different frequencies. While maybe the phone is manufactured with all the radios, they would have them turned off in countries where they are not licensed to use them. The result of all this is maybe poorer connections or battery life in some cases, but the device should still work anywhere unless it is locked to a carrier like what they do in the US. Another thing could be hardware. Sometimes you won't get Exynos or Snapdragon or whatever chip or LTE or 5G radios with certain memory or storage in one country even though the manufacturer makes all of them. The only other thing might be software? Like how UAE iPhones and FaceTime... But I think now they just tie that to which country you register in the software and not the device? Not sure any more.",7,2024-06-23 19:19:28,False,True,comment,dubai

Also, I think it would be best to just rent a car. Getting an uber would be more expensive when you can just spend it more on sight seeing/experiences here in the UAE. For hotels, would recommend staying near downtown. You can take a leisurely walk as the weather is still fine. There's also a variety of restaurant and coffee shops around the area and would be a nice time to wind down after a day of touring. The Dubai mall and Burj Khalifa is there and Museum of the Future is just nearby as well. Five Jumeirah Village is a bit far and also from the posts here before, they say it can be a bit loud as the parties are on goin albeit not sure now as it's the month of Ramadan so it might be a bit quieter but still, location-wise it's far. I think as a tourist, the sky dive would be a nice experience as you'd get to see a view of the palm. For other experiences, you can try the longest zip line - although this is in another emirate called Ras Al Khaimah. More details about that below. But that would be a good experience for you being a thrill-seeking individual. If I were you, my 4-day itinerary would look something like this: 1st day: March 20 (Arrival around noon) ‚óè Rest and freshen up for an hour or 2 ‚óè Before the sun sets, go to Burj Khalifa ""At The Top""; tickets are inside Dubai Mall or buy one online at their website https://burjkhalifa-dubai.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-cOmoe_2hAMVo4doCR3NPAuJEAAYAyAAEgLGkvD_BwE or check the Get Your Guide App ‚óè Evening time, head back to Dubai Mall; check restaurants with a view of the Dancing Fountains - that's hitting 2 birds with 1 stone (ie.

Check out the list here: https://www.timeoutdubai.com/food-drink/top-dubai-restaurants-and-bars-with-burj-khalifa-views ‚óè Head home to rest 2nd day: March 21 ‚óè Head to Museum of the Future, they open at 9:30am; get your tickets on their website at https://museumofthefuture.ae/en/book/general-offers/general-admission ‚óè The Dubai Frame is also nearby - it's just a view deck where you can see the old and new dubai.

1ac8cqo,Should i buy this ps5?,kjyozc2,Winter-Squirrel-1705,"Honestly, having owned a PS5 and my terrible experience with Noon, here's a few tips: 1. Try & avoid buying it from an online store. Sure, Amazon is way more reliable but you still have to check who the seller is and the reviews. Don't purchase it solely off of the reason that it's cheaper online. 2. The standard PS5 Dualsense controller is prone to getting stick drift issues, so I recommend getting the Edge controller or any other PS5 pro controller out in the market which has Hall Effect. 3. Dubai has many great retailers for electronics. However, Sony's licensed retailer in Dubai is Jumbo, so if you get a PS5 or PS5 controllers or accessories with Jumbo warranty, you'll never have a warranty related issue. Overall, do proper research before buying your stuff so you don't end up having buyer's regret (like I do for purchasing my PS5 on Noon)",1,2024-01-28 19:54:50,False,True,comment,DubaiGaming

Would suggest you to better go with Amazon as they are one of the global partners of Apple for iPhone sales and will give you proper description of the item on their listings page.

Like you add a 6 AED item they'll add a 10 tax (sometimes higher) then there comes the shipping fee then you'd have to end up paying 30+ AED for a 6 dirham item. The website/app itself is a scam I'd honestly advise someone to go to the mall or a supermarket and buy it from there instead. A VERY good laptop costs 6k AED and sometimes 5~4k AED I don't see why you'd spend that much on a Mac book... I'm not an apple user so I don't get why you'd do that when a gaming laptop is way more efficient and can do everything that a Mac could a Mac just looks fancy but is worse than a lot of gaming laptops lol... Tell them that you'll take it to court if they don't treat you and serve you like an actual costumer. 6k isn't a little money it's probably more than their paycheck so yeah...,2,2023-11-17 21:16:03,False,True,comment,UAE

Anything showing ‚Äúmarketplace‚Äù in Noon means it is fulfilled by 3rd party, for Amazon you can see fulfilled by whom under the price. So if you want to buy anything from those two, make sure of this points first. Next, in terms of returns, both will give you credits on the app instead of money even though you have your credit cards info stored.

Cashback of 10% will be in the form of noon credits only and I think this will most probably be instant since while signing up, they are asking for your noon account as well. 2. Since I am more interested in the 1000 AED cashback, I researched, talked to the agent (who in all my three different interactions have just given me info from the link you provided lmao) and got this: This 1000 AED cashback will be given to you at the end of the third month, given that you complete your minimum spend of 8000 AED in the first two months. Now here's the catch: the cashback will be adjusted on all the subsequent purchases (the purchases you make in the future)! Now I need to be sure whether this cashback will be on freaking Noon credits or any credit card spend. My questions (if you have done research, since I am late to this thread) are kinda the same as you: 1. Is this applicable while buying products worth 8k through EMI? 2. Cashback will be in the form of Noon credits or what? 3. How will the cashback be adjusted in all the subsequent purchases? They haven't mentioned this. I don't want a freaking max cap of like 200 AED (on each transaction till 1000 AED is saved) even if I spend 1000 more in the third month. 4. How long will the cashback be available for?

No, we want to make sure the package is attractive as we want you to be there with us 5 years from now. Also, nationality etc does not play a part in the offer, at all: the offer is actually standardized across.

If there is some genuine issue with the product, you can just specify it and return. I have returned a phone to noon this year, I know. The only main condition is that you shouldn't inflict any personal harm on the product. I have had to return a phone back to noon as well for overheating issues. They returned it back to me saying to 'claim warranty' rather than a straight return for a faulty device. They kept loitering around back and forth for the return window to close and boom, when the return window closed, they conveniently hung up. Also since you mentioned it, many noon express sellers explicitly mention in their return policy that if you remove the seal, you can say goodbye to return (be whatever the reason).

The layoffs at the Dubai-based e-commerce firm included roles in marketing and advertising, as well as in other departments, Alabbar said in an interview. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been cutting costs and reducing staff for the past year and a half,‚Äù said Alabbar, who owns 50% of Noon, while Saudi Arabia‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund owns the other half. ‚ÄúWe started before the big tech companies did but we‚Äôre done now.‚Äù Some of the world‚Äôs biggest tech companies have announced the largest rounds of layoffs in their history after a hiring spree during the pandemic left them with too many people. Amazon, Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. have all reduced headcount to cut costs and improve performance. As of early February, more than 67,000 jobs had been eliminated across the industry since the beginning of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Defying the Downturn In the Middle East, Softbank Group Corp.-backed startup Kitopi cut almost 2% of its workforce late last year, although some tech companies have managed to defy the global slowdown to raise funds from investors. As initial public offerings remain strong, some of the companies, including Noon and Kitopi, are viewed by bankers as long-term candidates for potential IPOs. However, Alabbar ‚Äî also the founder of Emaar Properties PJSC which built the world‚Äôs tallest skyscraper ‚Äî said there are no current plans to sell shares in Noon. Noon was created in 2016, with Alabbar raising $1 billion from backers including the Public Investment Fund to set up the firm. The company had been on an expansion drive as it sought to capture a larger slice of the Gulf e-commerce market. In 2021, Alabbar said investors including the PIF were set to inject $2 billion to help Noon upgrade its infrastructure to speed up deliveries. Speaking this week, he said the company‚Äôs ‚Äúcash burn rate has gone down drastically and our margins are getting better‚Äù and so it ‚Äúmay not need to get that $2 billion.‚Äù Noon operates in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt and was looking to expand in other nations across the Middle",37,2023-04-18 16:44:14,False,True,comment,dubai

Keep doing this for as many stores as there are before circling back to the first one and continuing the process.

I always buy express and check if the item is returnable. All the items that I don‚Äôt like I return them. I used to use amazon only for products that I could find on noon Amazons delivery is slower and I‚Äôve had may times wrong orders (ordered cookware and got wrong item. Ordered a memory foam mat and it took ages to come 28 days then it was so cheep and funky without memory foam and they charged me for return. Also I ordered a GPU for 9500AED from amazon and they never delivered it after just an h from when I order they increased the process of it to 10500AED so that if I want to cancel and reorder I will pay more for it. I wonder why you guys say amazon is better my iPhone and my wife‚Äôs iPhone is form noon and they are working great for years. I think all of us had an issue with whatever order to got. And now you guys trying to publicly shame noon so that you got what you want only. What you are saying is only your viewpoint the platform is not like this for all. Every platform have problems. From my viewpoint amazon is the worst one PS: All platforms have the same time to process a refund Also I bought a fridge from carrefour and it got broken after couple of months and they could not fix it and they are refusing to replace it while it is under warranty.

However always ensure you're buying from a good seller and not someone who has negative ratings. To answer your question middle east and US variants are snapdragon however just to be sure once you recieve it just make sure to check model number before opening the phone. You can have a look at which model numbers have snapdragon from this website: https://www.phonemore.com/models/samsung/galaxy-s22-ultra/ For example: SM-S908E this is the model I got and this is an Australian variant with snapdragon. The seller I bought it from is called quick buy they are a reputable seller and you can even call them before placing your order. The one I got said it was the international version, however middle east is also snapdragon but slightly expensive which I'm guessing is due to the physical dual sim capability.

x6p9jl,Better to buy on Amazon/Noon or Al Ain Centre ?,inkbur5,Sash716,"I know this might be a few days late, but here is my 2cents on the topic. Check prices everywhere. Don't just check Amazon/Noon or just Al Ain Center. When I built my system I checked prices everywhere. I found SSD/HDD, RAM, and PSU prices were almost the same between Amazon and Al Ain Center. I found CPU and GPU cheaper in Al Ain Center when I made my purchases (about 3 months ago or something I think.) For example, I got an Asus Strix 3070Ti for 3150AED (VAT included) in Al Ain Center, I think the cheapest I found on Amazon at the time was about 3,700 or something (I can't remember exactly to be honest). For my CPU, I found a 11700KF at Al Ain Center for the same price as a 11600K on Amazon. Not all prices are the same even in Al Ain Center. For example, the exact card I bought for 3150 was almost 4,000 at one store and 3,600 at another. This is what I did: I checked Amazon and other online retailers and found the cheapest prices I could for various components, along with various models of the same component (like the GPU). Wrote everything down on my phone. Went to Al Ain Center and asked for prices at as many stores as I could. Wrote the prices/models on my phone. Then went and sat at a coffee shop and started comparing everything. Since prices were either the same or cheaper at Al Ain Center (at the time) I went with Al Ain Center. Even then I bought things from a few different stores. One last point: When buying from Amazon some parts come internationally so they can be cheaper. For example, I found (and shared here) a 3090Ti OC edition on Amazon for 4,000 something but it was from Amazon US. So longer delivery time than if shipped from UAE. Might be something to consider. One last point - Part 2: Depending on your ""speech"" skills, you might be able to get some discount if you purchase a bunch of parts from the same store. Can't do that with Amazon :P Moral of the story: Check prices everywhere, no point in limiting yourself to just one place.",1,2022-09-08 12:31:21,False,True,comment,DubaiGaming

It also makes sense for Emaar to focus on noon and invest in its growth. Noon has achieved a very interesting position as a strong competitor for Amazon in the region. Amazon face(d) such stiff competition only in 2-3 markets. This is an exciting position to be in. I guess that they'd want to retain that position and grow. Having Namshi in the portfolio is a distortion of such ambitions.

w3f3hn,Fake Items through Noon - Samsung Galaxy S22+,igwfavh,myauntylovesyou,"thank you for getting this to my attention, don‚Äôt use reddit as much as before. u/No-Primary-7656 this likely seems the case for the phone being replaced by another customer who may have placed an order before you. So how noon express items work is, we deliver bulk quantities (think 3-400pcs) of phones every few days to noon. This is done to improve the shipment duration it takes for the phone to reach customers, as they are all already stored in the noon warehouse. Noon has various quality checks to determine if the product is eligible to be sold or not. From that point the logistics are under their control as the goods are handed over. What may have been the case, and has happened a few times too is, a customer may have placed an order, replaced the phone and returned it back for a refund, doing a good job of resealing the phone to claim it has never been opened. Noon will then place it back into our inventory and ship the order to another customer who placed the order, that customer being you. Although this is very much out of our control, i would like to apologize for the inconvenience, and i realize how absurd it may be to open a seemingly sealed phone for a gift to be a fake. I would like to offer you to visit out office and pick out your choice of phone having checked the condition before buying, would also attach a minor discount ( - the commission taken by noon). I can assure you our phones are professionally treated and are new. Also would like to inform that the reason for the chinese writings on the box is because of the phone being a Taiwan import, as they come with the Snapdragon processors which is considered better than the Exynos variant. I would also like to attach a few pictures that i asked one of our employees to send of a phone in our stock currently. Just to show the packaging/condition of our phones as they are delivered to noon. https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/7khxxd1dnxvw4u74ntnsr/h?dl=0&rlkey=xr3o6drwld0t9gyg788xy9ztt",29,2022-07-20 14:43:11,False,True,comment,dubai

User returns it to Noon stating they returned without opening the package. 5. Noon puts it back in their inventory and it gets sent out to another buyer.

I expected to be tackled by people criticising me but I'm glad all the responses have only been helpful so far! I have purchased laptops from Amazon once, In my case I haven't had any problems so far. An advantage Amazon returns provides is, It allows you to try out the laptop for a while and then return it no questions asked which is quite convenient. Noon is okay in terms of customer service but I will only buy their express items or at least those eligible for returns. Finally where ever you buy it from, the first 7 days are critical try and stress test the device as much as possible and try to look for any possible issues. Since this is the period offered by most retailers where they will provide a cashback or refund or at least a replacement otherwise u will have send it in for repair.

But the jump in price is unfortunately a bit too much. My parents are the ones who are buying the laptop, and as much as I know i could technically convince them by a lot of trying, it just doesn't feel right to ask them to buy something worth that much haha. If it were my own money, that's a different story ;) I think for now I'll just check up on some deals every other day or so. Also, do you have any advice when it comes to purchasing on Amazon and/or Noon? Any tips on checking the legitimacy of the seller, or any sellers to avoid or anything to that sort?

It was only 6 AED, lol, so low ticket item, I was just refunded. Point I'm making, which won't help now, is that in a case that you get something in a less than ideal condition, call them and tell them that's how you got it, instead of going through with the return and it being rejected.

I would suggest avoid buying from Noon/Amazon unless you know for sure that those are UAE models and the manufacturer will back it. That's what I would do if my TV borks any time.

Many warehouses in UAE offer places by square meter, even chillar ones. 4. You can also partnerup with delivery companies such as FedEx for all deliveries.

If a single one of these isn't optimized, you'll start losing revenue. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ You have another option. Partner up with Dubai SME FMCG companies in UAE dealing with all Hypermarket and Supermarket giants of UAE.

kyg40r,Fake or refurbished controllers sold in Dubai,gjfuyl7,bravo632,You should be asking this to the online portals who allowed this practice or have never tackled this problem. You have probably ordered them from different sellers on those platforms? Or from Noon/Carrefour directly? Amazon resellers are no different. Honestly there are better websites to order controllers from - use Virgin for an example. I never heard anyone complain about any issues with product authenticity from them. Geekay is probably the same too. Expensive? Yes but saves you the trouble. I hope returning those controllers is as easy as buying them.

So after constant pestering with noon support over the phone since Saturday with more than 10 calls I finally got somewhat of an answer from them. This afternoon I received a call from their complaints department and she pretty much said the same nonsense the noon support was saying about ""not sure why the stock hasn't reached the warehouse"". I kept pushing her to give answers as to why this happened and who was responsible for this fuck up. Finally she said that during the pre-order time, the seller has given a certain quantity to be sold as agreed with the distributor but the website didn't close on time so there were more sold than available units. God knows why they opened the pre-orders again in November when they fully knew they couldn't even fulfill all the October orders. A few hours later I got a call from Saudi which turned out to be from the escalation team and this guy had the most ""I-Don't-Give-Two-Flying-Fucks"" attitude and was basically reading off of emails that's been passed around. Which said that either: I cancel the order and receive a measly AED100 in Noon Credit LOL or just wait till they can somehow find the units from other sellers. I couldn't get any more info from him because he didn't have any more emails to read for me. All the apologies and the promises of ""solving"" the issue are useless because by principle they sold an item that they clearly didn't have the stock for. That's all I got for you my fellow gamers that were unlucky enough to order from this horrendous site. Do with the info what you want, I'm going to stick it out because I'd rather at least be on the system to get a PS5 if and when they receive it.

jnupvg,Noon launches its mobile wallet 'Noon Pay' in UAE,gb3sgnw,BarshanMan,"Noon has launched its mobile wallet ‚ÄòNoon Pay‚Äô in the United Arab Emirates without any fanfare. The launch was announced on Noon Pay‚Äôs social media accounts about three weeks ago. Noon has been working on it for over a year but never really shared any details. Earlier this year, the company had [won the initial approval](https://www.menabytes.com/careem-noon-mobile-wallets-saudi/) of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) to launch the mobile wallet in Saudi too so it is safe to assume that the UAE launch will be followed by the launch of Noon Pay in Saudi. In the United Arab Emirates, the mobile wallet is available as a dedicated app (for iOS and Android) that enables users to pay at partner outlets and for their Cash on Delivery orders from Noon by scanning a QR code, recharge their mobile numbers in UAE and over 50 other countries and recharge the Salik (electronic toll road system of Dubai) accounts or buy its recharge card. According to the information available on its website, Noon Pay has partnered with different companies to provide many additional services within its app. The partnership with Mr Usta enables users to book different home services including cleaning, AC maintenance, moving, handyman, and pest control. With the help of VoucherSkout, it offers deals (with up to 50 percent discounts) from different brands and stores including restaurants, spas, and gyms. The app also enables users to book air tickets through Cleartrip and cinema tickets from Reel Cinemas. The users can add money to Noon Pay by linking their debit or credit cards (Visa and Mastercard). The website doesn‚Äôt have any details on peer-to-peer transfers so that‚Äôs apparently not there yet. Noon earlier this year had announced a co-branded credit card in partnership with Mashreq Bank that would offer users up to 3.5 percent cashback on purchases made from Noon and free Noon VIP membership.

Dropped my Note 9 in the swimming pool and I'm heavily reliant on my phone for work purposes. I picked it up for 3499 after the same Noon 300 discount. I did my due diligence before making the purchase. 1. I picked it up from a trusted seller called Callmate, went on his Instagram, called him and had his word about everything including warranty for the International Version. Made sure I was getting the Snapdragon version instead of the EXYNOPE. 2. Once I made the purchase, prior to delivery you will get an invoice with the IMEI number of the Note 20 U you are purchasing, take that and go online and do an IMEI check to see if the phone is blacklisted, fake or if you are getting the right version. 3. This invoice is also your proof of purchase that serves as your warranty. Return to Noon in case of any issues and Noon will sort it out with the seller. 4. Make sure you get the N20 U Taiwanese version that gets you dual sim with hybrid memory card tray model N9860 5. It has been few weeks now, I've never been happier with the phone. Best of all, I received it in a completely factory sealed box with all the accessories and a phone cover complimentary within the box. 6.

Noon's average visit duration is 12.30. - [https://www.similarweb.com/website/carrefouruae.com/?competitors=noon.com#](https://www.similarweb.com/website/carrefouruae.com/?competitors=noon.com#) . That list of top ecommerce portals you shared makes zero sense ( also easier rookie links for you this time ) 2. Noon got 8M visits from UAE in sep 2020 - [https://www.similarweb.com/website/noon.com/#overview](https://www.similarweb.com/website/noon.com/#overview) 3. Amazon got 13.32M visits from UAE in Sep 2020 - [https://www.similarweb.com/website/amazon.ae/](https://www.similarweb.com/website/amazon.ae/) 4. Am ignoring a lot of other attributes to simplify the logical flow. 5. Assuming, they both have similar share of orders on the web ( this excludes revenue from app) & between them holding 98% of the market share ( should be 99.5% in the Generic eCommerce category, since rest of the competition is dead), Noon has 37% market share. I am saying they have 40% plus. They reached here in 3 years. Souq+Amazon are here for 14 years. You get the drift now? 6. Not considered noon's revenue from Kul, their ""noon daily"" traffic is yet to be tracked in similar web, etc. 7. on point #7, I shared the example of Europe startup ecosystem. There were hardly any challengers for Amazon, Uber, or any other American startups from Europe. Europe is considered to be the easiest market for American tech products. Middle east was like that till a few years back. It is only about 3-4 years since Middle east startups started challenging Global leaders. I was saying it is a good chance. Whereas, countries like China, India, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, etc have challenged every large-play consumer internet company from the US. There are homegrown Internet companies that are public and are generating huge profits. In short, global consumer-tech giants got fucked in these markets by local players. I come from that culture. So, supporting local startup is in our DNA. Hope you understood the scene now,........ child :)",0,2020-10-15 19:35:29,False,True,comment,dubai

I am a Amazon Prime user and few of my friends work in Amazon here and elsewhere. They are all smart people. 6. I like noon because it is a local challenger. Not sure if you are aware, there are very few platforms that took somebody like Amazon head-on in their territory. I am a fan of them for doing this. I love Flipkart too. 7. Personally am not a fan of an ecosystem similar to say Europe ( minus ex-soviet countries), which at best is easiest market for American tech products. ( Its not that i hate american tech products). There was hardly any challenge. Middle East was similar to this. It is only recently that you have seen local challengers taking global leaders like Uber and Amazon head on. I like this change because I come from a country where local startups give global guys a run for their money. So, that is more of a DNA thing.",1,2020-10-15 09:30:48,False,True,comment,dubai
javqao,NOON.com SOLD ME FAKE ITEMS 3 TIMES in a row,g8vel2w,box_man_ae,">similarweb.com First off, why do you have to be so toxic when you write? Its almost as if you own noon, and hate people for praising amazon. Other users are right. If they find a better customer experience, they go to amazon? Period. Why do you get so fired up about it? Are you Mohd Al Abbar? Anyhow, my main agenda is to debunk some useless claims that you've been throwing around. **1. Your theory on traffic** [amazon.ae](https://amazon.ae) is a website specifically for AE customers. [Noon.com](https://Noon.com) is a shared domain between AE and KSA customers. KSA is 3x the size of UAE in terms of population. Similar web is looking at ALL traffic coming to the above websites regardless of origin country. Despite amazon ae getting traffic from mostly UAE since its a UAE based site, and [noon.com](https://noon.com) getting combined traffic from AE and KSA, Amazon has higher traffic..!! do the math and find out how much traffic does Noon REALLY get. While I'm not a paid user of SimilarWeb - the top 5 ecommerce sites in UAE dont even feature Noon (sob sob) - [https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/united-arab-emirates/category/e-commerce-and-shopping/marketplace/](https://www.similarweb.com/top-websites/united-arab-emirates/category/e-commerce-and-shopping/marketplace/) &#x200B; **2. Your theory on Market Share (noon market share is \~ 40%)** This is an interesting one, and VERY difficult to pin down to. Both players operate in broadly speaking 4-5 categories and having 1st party (ships and sold by noon), and 3rd party (marketplace) operations. Categories are Consumer Electronics, Fashion, Home, Media, Grocery. In which category does noon have 45% market share? All of them? Impossible. One of them? Again impossible. Lets elaborate on this Consumer Electronics - is largely comprised of AMZN, Noon and post COVID even likes of Sharaf, Carrefour who've gotten serious about e-comm. Its IMPOSSIBLE that Noon has 40% market share with such heavy weights around them. You're saying Sharaf, Amazon and Carrefour take up the remaining 60%? Each one takes 20% market share? Fashion - This is a largely offline category. And brand owners (Apparel group, Al Shaya, Al Tayer) who own popular brands like Gap etc. prefer to use their own platform (eg. 6th Street) instead of working with general merchandise e-comm players. Even if the online market share of noon here is 45%, its irrelevant because the size of fashion is too small in online. Grocery - Again. Not possible. Carrefour is the heavy weight here. And you're not including app-native players like instashop. Its not possible to quantify exactly the market share here. and with Advent of hyper local grocery (noon now now) it makes it all the more difficult. Media - Again. Not possible. Media includes books, video games etc. I think for Books - Amazon can take the crown. I'm not sure of Video Games honestly. Home - This is a VERY large category, with very large sub categories - furniture, appliances, bedroom items, kitchen items with an expansive selection. Neither Amazon, nor Noon has the selection large enough to cover all these categories. so NO neither of the 2 have 40% market share. So where does Noon have 40% market share?? &#x200B; Care to elaborate?",2,2020-10-15 09:09:38,False,True,comment,dubai

Homie in Noon's engineering team here :) Starting today, you should have the option of cancelling items directly on the app (coming to web soon). We had this in our roadmap for a while but just got around rolling it out now :) In addition, we were looking at refunding directly to credit card after an order is cancelled, and that's been rolled out as of yesterday. If you place an order via credit card but then have to cancel it, we will now automatically refund it to credit card (to be precise: we first transfer the credit to your wallet, then to the credit card without you having to do anything). Soon you will also be able to specify whether you'd like all kinds of refunds (for example, when you return an item) to go to your Noon credits or back to the credit card. We might have some additional mode of refund coming up but I can't confirm 100% :) Truly sorry it took us a bit to get there -- in the past 3/4 months we've been planning to roll out some features that we believe are critical to the customer experience, and so in the next few weeks you should be able to see a lot coming up that makes it easier for everyone to safely shop at Noon.

ewr4zp,Help! Macbook Pro on noon.com?,fg3vspo,Spartanll,I've bought products from noon regularly. Usually the two things I like to check for are if the product is fulfilled by noon and the warranty. But to be honest with you I wouldn't buy apple products (especially a MacBook) from noon unless the seller is noon.com themselves. I wouldn't trust a seller even if they are fulfilled by noon for a product like this. Imo buying a MacBook is an investment and you shouldn't be tempted on getting one from a cheaper source especially if you yourself are having doubts about it. Sometimes that extra bit of savings can end up being a real pain in the ass in the long run. I suggest that you keep an eye out on the major retailers for this model.,6,2020-01-31 21:12:23,False,True,comment,dubai

Things were off to a good start! However, when I tried to buy Apple Care +, Apple said that the device is already covered by Apple Care+ (which was very strange) I called Apple customer service and they confirmed that the device has already been activated on 10/17/2019 AND already registered under Apple Care+ on 10.17.10 (i have an official email from Apple stating this, btw) which can only mean that this laptop isn't brand new anymore (because why would a reseller buy AC+ for a macbook they were planning on reselling?!

I think it looks more like a reset for all sellers and their reviews. It could be a good thing if they could implement more strict rules on reviews and feedbacks rather than us seeing all fake reviews. But not sure whether it would work well since manipulating reviews seems to be a major headache in other Amazon markets. I mean I was excited once for souq to be switched to Amazon. But later on I don't know I kinda fell into buying from Noon instead. Sometimes products sold by noon itself is way cheaper than Amazon.ae counterpart. Bought 3 mobile and a laptop from Noon in the last 6 month. Despite one occasion when my order was not delivered all others were fine. This is not a propaganda for Noon.

bgrdlt,Dear Noon,elnb0c1,Hamood3,"I had a similar experience recently. Ordered an electric scooter with a delivery time of 10 days. I found the same scooter with a better delivery time on Souq but the price was higher. I was willing to wait and was feeling in a ‚Äúsupport the local brand‚Äù mood. A day before the estimated delivery date someone from Noon called and said the supplier doesn‚Äôt have the item in stock and that they will try to source it from other suppliers. He said someone will call me back in a couple of days with an update. I thought fine I can wait another few days. I was actually impressed they called instead of sending an email. Guess what, no one called in a couple of days so I called back...blah blah...they can‚Äôt source it (I got the sense they didn‚Äôt really try too) and will issue a refund. Before I hung up I made sure I pointed out that I was trying to give Noon a chance over Souq but this incident turned me off completely and I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs the point in their public cry for support (a few months). I told him to mention those exact words in the order case. Their biggest problem in my opinion is that sellers aren‚Äôt really trying on their platform. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre there as a courtesy. Product selection is almost always poorer than Souq, and this is without Souq‚Äôs Global Store. Delivery times are mostly worse than Souq. And finally prices are almost always higher than Souq. They need to make it more attractive for sellers to focus on their platform. But I fear it is all too late now.

If they want to put in laws that Souq.com/Amazon should have a % of their information, customer, whatever office based in the UAE then they can. Data in general is almost all stored on overseas servers. While they are at it, they should also force companies to stop charging ridiculous premiums vs prices overseas. Although that may force rents down in malls. Emaar only grew to where it is because it was able to secure formal and informal partnerships with the governments.

Young Emiratis/saudis/Kuwaitis etc are likely to invest in existing startups or startup of their own, which is likely to help stable wealth generation and of course jobs and positive ripple effects on economy. So far, it is expats who took personal loan to startup here. Some of them have raised funds too. But if you see closely, majority of them do serious fraud in accounting practices, thereby wiring cash back home. Most of them declare bonuses for self and others in senior management the moment they start seeing some cash. The money doesn't stay here. If noon wins , the current climate is likely to change. For amazon, its basically a regional tick as of now. Dont expect them to take the region seriously. They are unlikely to invest loads of cash and grow the game untill they see others doing it. If they win big with no serious competition, its not gonna help the economy.

I'm concerned that the noon.com failure was a lot about a very hierarchical ""heavy"" style of management (we pay you lots, do what I say, you will work 7 days a week, otherwise I fire you) that simply cannot translate to building a thriving tech company. I compare this to a head chef I know works at a high-class Emaar restaurant, staff will be axed for simple failures, it's brutal - you will be replaced by the next service staff we will hire. So I think there are lessons to learn here, you can always hire more cement truck drivers, or brick layers - but you can't sack your tech team and replace them all - because everything inside their heads is what makes your company - your capital is your people that know your business deeply, your code and processes deeply, and the culture you have.

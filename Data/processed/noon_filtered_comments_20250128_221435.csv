Noon 15 minutes really made a huge difference (wasn't available when we first moved in) though food delivery is limited Ultimately, we moved because we couldn't justify the rental price. 1200sqft on 3 TINY rooms and balconies that are as big as the rooms themselves (unusable due to weather for 8 out of 12 months) Vehicle wear and tear! I removed 40!!!km daily on my commute that equates to, at best, 40 min (usually more due to traffic) In my opinion, it's only worth it if you have kids of 7 years +, They'll enjoy having friends in the community, and it's very safe there.",7,28/10/2024 10:53,FALSE,TRUE,comment,Positive

I moved form noon to namshi after it was aquired. \- The son of Mr Al abbar has nothing to do with namshi. he started a company that is called sivvi that was acquired by noon some 4-5 years ago \- Namshi was initially founded by Faraz, Hicham (current CEO and MD of noon) and a few other people backed by Rocket internet (german incubator company). \- Namsih exited by selling its shares slowly slowly to Emaar (which is owned by Mr al Abbar) \- Noon is founded by Mr al abbar and technically has nothing to do with Emaar. they just share Mr al abbar \- Namshi was later sold from emaar to noon. Now on the tech part and reliability issues: \- Namshi and noon share the same login credentials. So if you create a noon account you cna use the same one on namshi \- some of the backend stuff is shared across noon and namshi but not everything \- some tech glitches hence affect both namshi and noon \- there was a glitch a week or so ago that last for a few hours and was on and off which is whtat u/NinjaExorcist is probably referring to \- these downtimes are usually exceptions and in many cases are relevant to external serivices that we use \- in terms of return policy it is pretty open and verry rarely namshi asks any questions when people return things (not sure how long this will last) so make use of it \-refurnd typically happen wihtin 24hours from when the return is picked up \-delivery in UAE can happen in Same day if you order before around 1pm and roughly 98% of deliveries happen within the promissed time. \- in terms of pricing, alot of it is automated and hence you get heavy discounts and in some cases 1% discounts. The heavy discounts are all legit and its usually our liquidation and outlet inventory that we buy in order to discount and get customers \- all products are 100% authentic as we only buy directly on the brands \- some products will be available on both noon and namshi but that doesnt apply to all products.

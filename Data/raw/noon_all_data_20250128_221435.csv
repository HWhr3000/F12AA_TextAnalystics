I had purchased Apple Renewed - iPhone 12 Pro Max from Noon with 1year Warranty. The Product grade was Premium (top rate) and when i start using it, i faced touch issue. and very soon its batter got swellen and screen came out. When i raised warranty Claim, initially they refused to cover under warranty, as as per them it was with 6months warranty, but since i had raised claim within 6month of period, they agree to take the phone for repair. They were kept delaying it and since delay, the screen which had come out due to battery swellen issue, it got crack and because of this crack reason, they found excuse and didnt repair the phone. I had shared the picture and video as initail stage and there was no crack, and since they took 6weeks to pick the phone, the batter swellen issue caused the damage in screen which they didnt repair, not even battery and returned the phone opened. i recommend everyone, DONOT buy anything from #noon other wise be ready to face such issues. they were very very unethical, unprofessional who knew that the phone issues are under warranty, phone is under warranty, still they tried their level best to make me fool that phone is not under warranty and cannot be repair and at last, they returned the phone opened.",1,2024-08-20 13:24:37,True,True,post

1cvwbpb,Harassment by Noon.com and it's return policy - May 2024,1cvwbpb,Disastrous_Note_5024,"UPDATE (20th of May 2024) I apologize for not paying close attention to Noon’s return policy. It is clearly stated that opened items cannot be refunded, as Noon cannot resell or return them afterward. Thank you for all the comments and to the Noon help center for clarifying this policy. This rule applies to returns in the UAE ///////////////////////////////////// Good day everyone, Following up on the problem discussed in post ""Harassment by Noon and it's return policy"", in which Noon refused to refund a customer for a product that doesn't fit, I'd like to tell my story with them. So, I ordered a Samsung S22 Ultra on the 11th of May at noon for AED 1,945. The product was delivered on the 17th of May, in the evening, with the box already damaged. This is not a major problem, however in context. After checking the phone in the evening of the same day, I examined it more closely and realised that it is not suited me as a gadget. I decided to return the product in the same condition as was (no scratches, no missing parts) - Photo 1 [Photo 1. Condition of the phone which I returned](https://preview.redd.it/4nuilqdunf1d1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=311fc845bbe9d8ddb871ddab357ed1d0f100293a) So I create a return request without any hindsight. Yes, I opened the box, but everything else was original. And I make the refund request the same day I received it (17th of May). The next day the courier picks up the phone and the request starts to be fulfilled - Photo 2 https://preview.redd.it/vz5w8pp70g1d1.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=d69690c51ab37e5848bd902c6cdcfa33443a8dac Today - 19 May - they send me a notification that the item cannot be returned because the box has already been opened. Every shop *(not really, I think only Amazon are being very nice about their returns policy right now, however they can't officially return opened goods either)* in the UAE is willing to refund If you have bill and do so within 15 days of purchase Noon refuse to me in this return - Photo 3 https://preview.redd.it/morgoa190g1d1.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=70ab57d4bdd0de10f22ec5c26d2121e3f54d904b As a result, product returned to me with no potential availability to reimburse money Generally it is rule of all stores, but in Europe usually it is a little bit different, that is why I thought the same rules applicable her * Amazon officially will not return product which is opened - however most of the case they agree to do it - [https://www.amazon.ae/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKM69DUUYKQWKWX7](https://www.amazon.ae/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKM69DUUYKQWKWX7) * Samsung, SharafDG, Jumbo does not allow to return opened product * Apple Store officially will return product in 15 days Be attentive during ordering expensive products, otherwise you will not be eligible for return.

1exj13k,The Smartphone has become the super app - UAE Perspective,1exj13k,startuphameed,"We are seeing many Super App attempts from the UAE. The most prominent ones are Careem, Botim and Smiles. There are at least 30 other not-very-popular attempts. I am making an attempt to discuss the scope of super apps in the UAE, influenced by a recent story I read. I read [this story about the Indian app Hike and how it failed in a popular startup and business publication, The Morning Context](https://themorningcontext.com/internet/the-forgotten-lessons-of-hike-part-iii) from India, known for doing long-form beautiful stories covering startups and other businesses. ( It is behind a paywall that I couldn't crack). This brilliant business journo Harveen Ahluwalia's story outlines how our smartphones have become the super app and how it resulted in this whole smart-app discourse getting derailed now. The story is about a high-investment ( upward of a billion $ from VCs like SoftBank, etc.) attempt to build a super app in the style of WeChat, Line, etc., that eventually failed. For the contest, Botim is making a similar attempt here. Let's look at the other super app play relevant to Dubai. Gojek, the Indonesian app, cracked this code to make people consume a lot of services within their platform. Supposedly, the first Unicorn from Indonesia eventually became a decacorn. The founder, Nadeim, a Harvard grad and McK alumni, even became a Minister of education and technology in Indonesia. A fun fact is that they had their entire tech, product, growth, marketing etc in India. Flights from Delhi/Bangalore to Indonesia are always filled with Gojek employees. They turned into a super app by around 2016 with many services offered to the users who used bike-taxi and cab services, becoming this one-place-for-all app. I observed high adoption for this product when I visited Indonesia. They went public. But here's the catch. They had to merge the business with Tokopedia, the noon equivalent of Indonesia, to go to IPO. [They opened at IDR 442 on 14th April 2022 and are currently trading at IDR52. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOTO.JK/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIFOSY1H7XMk3yZiPGfwEA2h0MSll_1zv4qKIMzP5Ye_FYUmPdlM2plICNoE3Hfv2xM9Det6TfTmw7ZHH0cTi8kPiFdaRsUeTcnufUuOlPZWpE9sAmRUDrjYLFCk0me9nX0IP62AQcpSfAa2--Un56jeKmO0vCVqb6mTMaeFMGL6) Many have attempted to clone this across the world and mostly have failed so far There are a lot of attempts to crack this play in UAE by botim ( following the WeChat & Line model), smiles and many others. However, Careem is making one prominent attempt. Careem split only this business from Uber to become an independent entity, with Uber retaining a stake and Etisalat investing in the business for equity. For Careem, this model is a straight fit since Gojek also originated from Cab hailing. So, it is a pixel-to-pixel and ppt slide to ppt slide clone. They have experience in doing 100% cloning earlier when they cloned Ola, the Indian cam aggregator's business model, app etc and ended up winning. I also heard that the whole product was built in Bangalore. ( Not taking the credit away.... full marks for execution, and So the guess is that they are masters of cloning. The super apps idea worked for Gojek because it was relevant in an era when, way back in 2014, it was difficult to add and store a payment card in an app, and the devices also lacked space for many apps. Their share trading at only 13% of their IPO launch value validates this truth. So, what is the future for UAE's super apps? Can they beat the conclusion derived from past performance data in different regions? But the most relevant conclusion is what the story I mentioned outlined - **SmartPhone is the super app now** - What is your opinion on this ? PS: I don't want to undermine Careem's mammoth execution capability. I wish them good luck, but from what I have observed, they may be finding it extremely difficult to crack this code.",6,2024-08-21 11:00:06,True,True,post
1exj13k,The Smartphone has become the super app - UAE Perspective,lj6fsap,theboriginal,"First, smartphone can’t be super app, I mean the sentence doesn’t make sense. Second, in order to have something like WeChat government needs to stand behind it here. Market is full of scammers and spammers, so people are not too happy adding bank and full personal details to any new ‘super’ app, unless guaranteed by government. And also to monitor full implementation in the system. Third, majority of people are expats, therefore very different mentality towards ditching all their daily apps for a new one that nobody uses in their own country. Simple example is Botim, which will never succeed. There is no theory people in Europe or US will install one app just to talk to one person abroad. Fourth, in order to become super app, it must act like a bank, something that Careem is trying. My conclusion is that instead on focusing to be super app, they should all focus on quality of service, because it’s deteriorating for years now. All services are worse and worse, everything is outsourced, and god forbid you need to start jumping through customer support hoops. Also, the population is too diverse for one app to be able to target everyone’s needs. If you target big groups specifically, like Indian, Pakistani or Filipino for example, it would be much easier to execute, based on cultural/background similarities.",23,2024-08-21 12:19:23,False,False,comment

1exj13k,The Smartphone has become the super app - UAE Perspective,lj6h6gz,startuphameed,"**Okay. I've included the part of the story that triggered this, thought. It is copyright protected, and I hope I don't get a bloody legal notice.** ""The smartphone became the super app’ At the heart of it, Hike’s super app was supposed to fix a key gap: there was no one place—app or website—where users could conveniently access a number of services. Also, for individual services, users couldn’t download, install and store apps on their phones as easily as they do today. At the time, mobile storage was scarce, the internet was slow and expensive, and not every online service was available on an app. Plus, Indian users had not taken to apps either. In 2015, for instance, online shopping startup Myntra shut down its website to be an app —only to relaunch the website less than a year later. These factors majorly impeded the usage of online services—a problem that Hike’s super app intended to solve. But over the years, the internet opened up and mobile storage was no longer an issue. People started to download as many apps on their phones as they wanted. Basically, individual shops had become a lot more accessible now and there was little use case for the marketplace of Hike.“This was the onset of cheap data, 4G, superior smartphones with little constraints on storage/memory at reasonable prices,” says a Hike spokesperson in response to a query sent by The Morning Context. “The need for the super app was gone. The smartphone became the super app.” —A Hike spokesperson “I’ll go a step further and say the app store became the super app anyone needed,” says the former Hike executive quoted above. That is possibly the biggest and most neglected takeaway from Hike’s decline. The idea of a super app belonged to a time when there was a technological constraint; it makes little sense otherwise. Why do users need a super app when their smartphone can accommodate as many apps as they want?—a billion-dollar question, even today. Coming back to Hike’s troubles, that its super app was going to be a flop show was now clear as day to the company. Service by service, the platform was also starting to move away from the offering and focus on something that was actually relevant and worked.

1exj13k,The Smartphone has become the super app - UAE Perspective,lj6p7dk,theboriginal,"Regarding my first take about smartphone being super app, I still stand by what I said, it makes no sense. And I didn’t say it in order to trigger you, just wanted to state the obvious. Even in the continuation of the text they say app store is super app, which would make slightly more sense. 😄 Regarding the rest in the article, it clearly shows the specific use case and the problem that app solved to that customer base, which was smart. Now, are super apps dead, over 1 billion people market in China and other parts of Asia, would definitely disagree. Even though they all have phones that can store many apps. So that again shows the reason I mentioned culture influence as one of the factors in my previous comment. Simple example are Chinese websites and apps design, where for majority of people they look too cluttered and full of confusing stuff. Until you realize that amount of information and choices visibly displayed together, actually give peace of mind and serve to reassure customers and help them make proper choices. Similar case is in Japan. So overall they prefer information, over the aesthetics. Contrary to more western way of working with information and design. So in general, I am sure, as your case from the article shows, super apps can be very useful but they need to cater to either specific groups, or specific problems. Which is why, for now, we don’t have proper super app in UAE.",2,2024-08-21 14:00:57,False,False,comment

That’s a whole ecosystem setup which probably no one else in the world can replicate without proper govt backing. Regards to Botim, I can see it working for them for blue/grey collars. This whole trust thing that us redditors/white collars have for Botim doesn’t really replicate in other segments of users. In fact it might be opposite where users might be seeing it as govt backed hence more trustable. The biggest advantage they have vs others is marketing burn cost. 80% of the UAE users already have their app. That’s huge compared to any other player.

1exj13k,The Smartphone has become the super app - UAE Perspective,lj7pb95,startuphameed,">Now, are super apps dead, over 1 billion people market in China and other parts of Asia, would definitely disagree. Even though they all have phones that can store many apps. So that again shows the reason I mentioned culture influence as one of the factors in my previous comment. My theory is that the adoption in China, Japan and Indonesia happened during an era where smartphone wasn't as smart as today. The general thumb rule in consumer space is that once a product is adopted, it results in habit creation. So, in case of China, Japan and Indonesia (mainly), the adoption is created. Indonesia was a bit late to the party and triggered a super app play completely different from that of China and Japan. China and Japan's super app creation was triggered by messaging apps like WeChat, Line etc. Unfortunately, When Indonesia was ready, it was a market that already adopted WhatsApp. Hence, a successful bike-hailing app like Gojek jumped in tried to be super app, which has worked since other categories still need to be established there. My hypothesis is that the UAE is a market where food delivery adoption happened long ago, as did other services that Gojek established in Indonesia. Gojek's missing piece was generic e-commerce, which they tackled by merging Tokopedia and going public together. Now, in spite of establishing all that, Gojek is still finding it difficult to maintain the euphoria, and its stock price is falling. It is facing invasion in all its established categories from others. Now, careem seems to be late to the party and is primarily integrating existing #2 or #3 players into their app ( Justlife, washmen etc ) and handling the food play directly. They are still not able to see traction. This leads to the partially validated assumption that they may not become the super app they aspired to because smartphones have already become super apps. But we cant say.... Careem might end up surprising everyone by cracking this code. But in the case of botim and others, the ship has sailed long back. If there is a new super app player, they also need to work on establishing it. So am guessing it to be an extremely difficult play This also poses some questions related to the ""potential plans"" of all those BNPL players and other fintech apps that have raised capital, showing a potential scenario of them offering a lot more services to their user base once they cross the inflection point. PS: I am also not arguing. I am just sharing the process by which I reached this assumption.",2,2024-08-21 18:19:22,True,False,comment

In terms of Careem, I think what will prevent them from becoming super app is outsourcing and lack of quality control in that area. A lot of people had bad experiences with those providers, and won’t consider using them again. Especially here where market is very competitive and small, it takes very little to lose customers loyalty. Let’s remember Zomato, that completely fell apart, and Talabat ate them alive. I feel if Talabat and Careem merge, plus if they get something like Noon/Namshi or similar ecommerce plus banking, all incorporated, could be promising.

They sold their delivery business to deliveryhero and exited the market from a business that was making losses across the world to focus on their home market ie India. They acquired Grofers, a loss making grocery delivery business and converted it to quick delivery model. Rebranded it to blinkit. They built a restaurant supply chain model behind Zomato. They became #1in India on food delivery and quick grocery. Went public (IPO) and in 2 years turned profit for last 2 quarters.. They continued their restaurant discovery, booking and Zomato gold in UAE. Now if Zomato founders are half as intelligent as they really are, they would have signed a non-compete agreement limited by x years. What I heard is that the period is coming to an end soon. So, they are likely to come back to the market now when cost is optimised. They are gonna eat Talabat alive in few year's time.

Checking the delivery date on your purchase and make sure to set your delivery address to the hotel that you're staying at for that day. I would advise using one hotel as a longer stay and having it delivered there. Especially within Dubai city limits you should easily have a hassle free delivery.

1ch1gvo,I believe (and have plausible proof) that Noon is involved in a massive databreach,1ch1gvo,MRC2RULES,"Okay, where do I start Let me first hook you up with my experience of getting hacked on noon https://www.reddit.com/r/UAE/s/uUCfU8ZEbg I have crosschecked and I am 100% sure that noon is all to blame here. There was no issues or hacking from my side. And the POST itself describes the exact same situation as mine. Getting hacked randomly but not recieving any OTP (you ALWAYS recieve an SMS when trying to log in) Just googling about noon hack will give you many results Now for the past few months, I have been receiving scam sms messages from numbers from countries all around the world. All of them are some fake sms claiming to be from Saudi Post and say you have an undelivered package. Then they ask you to pay ""1.13SAR"" but in reality someone was robbed off of 12,000 RIYALS!! Now what does that have to do with Noon? I posted the screenshots on r/saudiarabia and many users claimed the same thing happening to them! Guess what everyone had in common? All of them had noon accounts. Even my friend was affected by this spam Now there is definite plausibility that noon is responsible for an insecure database since how do you get hacked on noon and soon after start getting spam messages? That too alongside the correlation of people who are getting spam texts with people who have noon accounts Extra Info: I had my noon account compromised. And since I do not use noon regularly, I forgot the password. What do you do? You hit forget password, get an email, and reset the password. What about noon? THERE IS NO FORGET PASSWORD OPTION. You can only reset it provided you remember the old one. Else what? Else you're fucked, support cannot do anything. Your account is in the hands of a malicious individual and you cannot do anything TLDR: Noon is incredibly insecure and is leaking their phone number database.

1fogqo1,Amazon and Noon cannibalising it's market place ,1fogqo1,waseembelushi,What started as one of the best businesses for selling online as it turn against the very users who helped it get there in the first place. Here is a video explaining that in dept https://youtu.be/CNIsjGqMMWQ Credit to YT Clynt Both Amazon and Noon have started gating products which do well online and have cut out the sellers who have listed the products in the first place. After selling on Amazon (then souq.com) for more 8 years I can been gated to sell the products which helped me during my hard times. I was a advocate for selling on marketplaces but now seeing many of the companion products go to Amazon it seems like a clap on face for sellers who have contributed towards their growth. I am to blame since I saw the signs but kept going since I had no means to support my family. It's a hard lesson but life goes on.

1i6gunq,Amazon/Noon Listing in the UAE,m8isppy,abobobilly,"For account creation, it's easy and straight forward. Head to the Seller Central and create the business account with your LLC. The verification process will take a little longer, as they'll send a physical OTP letter by mail to your registered address, and then an amazon rep will need to do a live call with you to setup and activate your account. Your first payment will be about $50 as the USA store will be the first store you'll activate (If i recall it right), which can be refunded back to you after you disable the USA store and enable the UAE one. For the products listing, if you got some time, then you can do it yourself. Otherwise, i'd recommend you hire an employee to manage this segment as it gets frustrating very quickly. Once your SKUs are live, then generating sales really depends on your business model, and the marketing budget. Personally, Amazon is a necessary evil. A place where you have to be present for visibility but don't count on it for making money. You can have better options using traditional marketing through TikTok/Insta/FB etc. Considering the size of your company, i assume you already have a marketing budget of sorts ?",1,2025-01-22 15:54:38,False,False,comment

1egdsba,Perfume under 30aed | UAE,lfs0ls7,Good_Big9839,"You're unlikely to get truly ""good"" perfumes in that price range, with respect to quality. The ones you might get under AED 30 will not last much or could smell quite harsh due to the quality of the ingredients. That being said, a perfume being ""premium"" does not also mean that they last long. However, do try Lattafa perfumes. They are really good for the price. I would also suggest checking out Ahmed Al Margribi. Excellent perfumes, that start from around AED 60. The Sapil line from Swiss Arabian is also worth a look. Personally, I find Sapil Solid pretty good. Other than for these, you could try out local mall kiosks or brands that sell clones of popular perfumes to get a general vibe of the same. Some in fact may last longer and be stronger than the real thing. But the quality of these will vary from batch to batch, as they are not mass produced in factories.

So you do what they ask which are pretty easy tasks and then they ofcourse ask you for money. Well when they told me about it I asked to be added .. at first they told my friend that she can't refer anyone. But later they finally texted me on whatsapp and added me .. I kept getting money sometimes its 5dhs, 10, even 20 !! for each task. I kept playing with them and actually succeeded in scamming the scammers ! I got around 3000 out of them 😂 the trick is ..

1dbpqpf,UAE to Experience Longest Day of the Year with Nearly 14 Hours of Daylight,1dbpqpf,academiasupport,"This year, the UAE will witness its earliest summer solstice on June 20th or 21st, marking the earliest global occurrence since 1796. During this event, the UAE will enjoy its longest day of the year, featuring 13 hours and 48 minutes of daylight. According to Ibrahim Al Jarwan, Chairman of the Emirates Astronomical Society, the solstice will position the sun directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer, resulting in minimal shadows at noon in the southern UAE and shorter shadows across the Arabian Peninsula. Daytime temperatures are expected to range between 41-43°C, with nighttime temperatures between 26-29°C under dry conditions. The first half of summer will see these conditions persist, while the latter half, from August 11 to September 23, will bring increased humidity and the arrival of moist Kos winds, likely leading to thunderstorms.",40,2024-06-09 13:20:53,True,True,post

1eucho5,I know it's a trick that restaurant on Noon use but at this point it's just hilarious 😂 ,lik68yr,Traditional_Rope_904,"True, and it’s very interesting how companies get around this. For example, in the UK, some clothing stores will have a tiny branch that costs very little to run, in literally the middle of nowhere (often in the wilderness areas of Scotland). Because it’s so remote, nobody ever visits this branch. What they then do, is they put one piece of each item they eventually want to put on sale, at an extremely high price, in this branch only. Let’s say it’s a T-shirt; they listed at £100 for the required period. Then, when they want to run their sale in all the other branches, they can list the item at £10 and say it’s 90% off. But yeah, these sales are an absolute joke here. I find these”Part Sale: 25% - 75% Off” particularly funny. All they have to do is have one item, which can sell out immediately, at 75% off, with everything else at 25% off. Technically they haven’t lied, so if they were ever held to account for such bold claims (which they never would be anyway), they’re safe.",8,2024-08-17 17:13:05,False,False,comment

1ftkhs9,How credible is noon?,1ftkhs9,SpecialAstronaut2385,Hello everyone I am planning to buy a macbook from noon. THis is my first time ever making a purhcase from noon so I am slightly scared. Noon offers a very competitive price and it is significantly cheaper than apple website. My seller i want to buy from has a very good rating (4.8) 100& item as described. However I am still scared as I heard noon doesnt offer refund to original payment method and that the customer support is very bad as well. Also is it possible for me to chose COD(cash on delivery ) method and when i recieve the product can i open the box and check the serial numbers and if the laptop is working and then pay?

1b73r5s,Food Delivery on a Rainy Day,1b73r5s,Prior-Army-4041,I was at First Avenue Mall in Motor City yesterday evening when it was raining. A few seconds afterI left the parking and joined the road a noon delivery rider fell on the road as his bike slipped on the slippery bricked road. As soon as this happened another delivery rider tried to slow down carefully but his bike also slipped and he fell. I stopped the car and asked them to just park until it stops raining (I know they can't but i tried). The guy just shrugged and carried on. I took the u-turn towards MBZ and there was a car jam. Turns out another noon delivery guy slipped. Its that damn bricked road. My request to folks from motor City is to not order during a rainy day. Its dangerous for these riders and they are forced to do it.,80,2024-03-05 16:12:36,True,True,post

1gduk7v,Damac Hills 2 Recent Thoughts?,1gduk7v,Basic-Ad-1756,"Hi All, so I've been seeing alot of hate towards Damac Hills 2 but mostly are outdated posts. There are feedback about unavailable food delivery services, long travel distances, problems with security having to get NOC for each service provider, problems with maintenance... I'm planning to move there given the extreme rental increases across, DH2 is still justifiable comparing to what you get. My main questions as of today, and if anyone can please help 1- Does it still feel like the outskirts (keeping distance out of this) in terms of food delivery services and such? I have been checking and can see many of the restaurants I love and usually order do deliver through Careem from Motor City and there is also Noon 15 mins grocery and Instashop. 2- Is it truly a nightmare if you need to get a service provider? for example if I do need some maintenance works done? or if I need to get a pet groomer 3- In terms of distance, yes I do understand the location and how far it is, but I have been comparing it with current travels and I don't require to go to work every day, so I think that should be ok. But in terms of traffic during off peak times from Downtown to DH2 any thoughts? And if anything else comes to mind please let do share. Thank you for your time.",9,2024-10-28 09:12:02,True,True,post

Size and layout depends on the size and layout you choose - we have a really decent r2em layout and bedrooms are more than decent, kitchen and maids is great - but we sacrificed a bit of lounge - not an issue for us. Community is marvellous, community center has all the essentials and more (parking at the shops is less so best to walk there or avoid rush hour times). Facilities and amenities are perfect - every cluster has its own pool and kids play area, plus a D2 water park, aviary, paint ball park, dog park, cricket pitch, tennis courts, 7km cycling and running track, free gym. There are 3 exits - is there traffic during peak hours - yes, but where in the world wouldn’t there be? Town Square and Mira peeps are just cross because you should see what they have to deal with 😆 I work around Dip/ furjan, husband goes to Mirdif’s side - we both have a breeze of a commute (I take Lahbab road he takes Al Ain road) because we travel outside of peak times and I skip so much traffic using Lahbab and for you Al Ain will be super easy to go downtown, the only busy road is qudra road but that is because you get stuck with Town square, Mira, Mudon, Ranches traffic all bottle necking at the big round-about. Yeah, build quality is a bit poor- but tbh, it’s what I can afford. The recommendation to move to Sharjah is a joke- rents have gone up there and you’ll spend 1/3 of your day in traffic. Damac have white spot cleaning and maintenance which come out same/ next day. Lots of local maintenance companies that can come to you within the hour- you ask your security at your cluster to hook you up with a guy- the have contacts to everyone : maintenance, landscaping, plumbers, car washers - you name it. Decent fast food options, carrefour delivers within 60min. Again, it depends on your budget- if you can afford Mudon, Ranches, D1, Meadows, Furjan, Emirates Hills etc, then comparing D2 to those places doesn’t make sense. But, if you’re a middle class bougie just trying to get a little bit of that villa lifestyle on your modest salary - then D2 is the answer. Just having a garden and getting out of apartment living makes all the small issues completely worth it! d2 does have a slight longer commute, but what you add in distance, you’ll save in sitting in mind-numbing traffic. Best decision I’ve made and again, for what I can afford - so much value for money.",10,2024-10-29 02:04:53,False,False,comment
1gduk7v,Damac Hills 2 Recent Thoughts?,lu512mo,_ballzdeep_,"I lived there for 2 years, just moved 10 days ago. The community and atmosphere are very good, especially if you have kids. Construction quality is cheap: Painting popping off. Kitchen roof leaking during any rainy day that lasts more than 30 minutes. Weak water pressure in bathrooms upstairs. Noon 15 minutes really made a huge difference (wasn't available when we first moved in) though food delivery is limited Ultimately, we moved because we couldn't justify the rental price. 1200sqft on 3 TINY rooms and balconies that are as big as the rooms themselves (unusable due to weather for 8 out of 12 months) Vehicle wear and tear! I removed 40!!!km daily on my commute that equates to, at best, 40 min (usually more due to traffic) In my opinion, it's only worth it if you have kids of 7 years +, They'll enjoy having friends in the community, and it's very safe there.",7,2024-10-28 10:53:10,False,True,comment

1gduk7v,Damac Hills 2 Recent Thoughts?,m0k7u4o,jontysafe,We lived in Aster for 3 years. In a standalone 6 bed v3. Absolute bargain compared to anywhere else in Dubai. We had a corner unit with a nice garden. We were first tenant so we had to fix out garden. Could afford to do that as we were paying so much less than the 6 bed in The Villa Project. Build quality shoddy yes and I was told to budget for AC repairs which we did. Find a good supplier and clean the outside units ever 3 months and you’ll be fine. The key is finding one with an understanding landlord. We were very lucky. Personally I liked how far it was from Dubai as we are country folk not city folk.,2,2024-12-05 20:41:01,False,False,comment

It's just another 10 minutes when there is no traffic, but when there is traffic, it's going to turn into 30-40 minutes that may often set your hole day upside down: you'll see the traffic in the opposite direction and an influx of people exiting town square speeding towards al qudra roundabout just to merge back with people leaving mira and coming from DH2. All that on a 2 lane road... If you have to be there between 7-8AM every morning in a car, then probably it's better to understand the situation you are getting yourself into.

1csneh9,Fake AirPods on Noon,1csneh9,oriented_ace,"I recently purchased AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) on Noon, they have something called 1 hour Rocket Delivery so I used that. The product was also sold by Noon. The item I received is counterfeit and I will give you the reasons now: 1. On the case it says assembled in USA - no AirPods are assembled in USA, it is always either in China or Vietnam. (Image 2) 2. Serial number on the box is different from that inside the case and also while it says assembled in USA on the case it says assembled in China on the Box (See image 1 & 2) 3. The MagSafe charging does not work. The transparency mode does not work and the noise cancellation does not work. The adaptive mode which is a feature in AirPods Pro (Gen 2) does not show up at all. I have filed for a return and it has been declined because apparently the quality check team says it is fine.

D2C E-Commerce in Mainland (Ownership of Goods is with your (FZ) company):** **FZ companies can't import directly into mainland (correct?)** **Also FZ companies can't deliver directly to individual consumers in mainland (correct?)** **Solution:** Hire a clearing agent to import your goods from FZ/Overseas to mainland and transfer ownership of goods to your company finally. Store goods in subleased WH and fulfil last mile delivery through a courier agent. **(correct?)** **2) Buying from a local company in mainland and selling to another local company in mainland:** **Solution:** Simply follow Order/Invoice/Payment process with both companies, delivery of goods need to happen thorough logistic partner, can’t be delivered by FZ company. **(correct?)** \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* **Original Post:** Hi, There is so much ambiguity online & confusing advice about Freezone Companies operation with businesses in mainland. Title explains, seeking for advice/info from actual business owners of FZ companies, who are already doing business with mainland companies on how it works. (I intend to have a General Trading License in Meydan FZ and work with Mainland/External companies B2B only & plan to sell some stuff online via AMZ/Noon. In mainland or FZ, I don't plan to lease a physical office and/or rent a Warehouse with Ejari in my company name or plan to open a Physical Store or work with Govt depts., hence not opting for Mainland General Trading License due to high cost). I know there are 1000's of FZ companies doing business with mainland companies and how they do is as below, What I have gathered till now by from various people/companies/internet. Please validate as true or post correction where applicable: **1. D2C E-Commerce in Mainland (Ownership of Goods is with your (FZ) company):** **FZ companies can't deliver directly to individual consumers in mainland (correct?)** So, you can sublease a fulfillment Centre or Warehouse in mainland **(can we?)**, can have your own website selling your stuff **(can we?)** and/or can list in Amazon/Noon etc.,. The order from your website/AMZ/Noon goes to WH/Fulfillment Centre, they or your hired courier company deliver last mile to individual customers in mainland, your inward inventory & sold is tallied and you get your sales amount directly in your business bank account from your website/AMZ/Noon. (in any case FZ company/person simply can't take a Van/Car and deliver the goods by themselves to customer in mainland) **Also FZ companies can't import directly into mainland (correct?)** Then to get your goods to that WH/Fulfillment Centre, you need to:: **a) Your Own Imported Goods** \- Issue order to your supplier in China etc., pay them directly from your Business Bank Account. then either **a1)** Pick the goods via shipping company from their port/WH and bring into any FZ (with port like JAFZA) with your own Import Code. (Because you can't import into mainland with your Import Code) so hire a clearing agent, transfer ownership of goods to them, they inward the goods into mainland in their Import Code by paying custom duty & VAT etc.,, then transfer ownership of goods back to you & deliver the goods to your chosen WH/Fulfillment Centre. or **a2)** Let that shipping company pick the goods from origin itself as a shipper & consignee as well, bring the goods directly to mainland (by paying custom duty/VAT) to your chosen WH/FC and transfer the ownership of goods to your FZ company name (avoiding multiple charges/effort of transfer of ownership as in a1). It's said that many companies get fines at time of audit/inspection, because they sometime get the goods released from JAFZA/RAKEZ Port etc., (JAFZA/RAKEZ releases goods without you paying custom duty/VAT assuming the goods are going to another FZ, that is, where your company is hosted say Meydan FZ). If these goods are taken goods to WH/FC in mainland instead of your host FZ area and start selling, then it's liable to fines and bans. **b) Goods are Already in any of FZ area imported till FZ by some other company:** Need a similar arrangement as in a1, either that FZ company (or your FZ company if ownership transferred to you) need to hire clearing agent to bring goods into mainland by paying custom duty/VAT and deliver to your chosen WH/FC and transfer the ownership to your FZ company. **c) Goods are Already in Mainland** : **c1) Buying from Local Mainland Company Directly (can we?)** Simply issue order to local company and pay via your business bank/cheque and let them deliver to your chosen WH/FC. **(right?)** (does the ownership of goods transfer happen to you simply by executing this transaction of issuing PO/getting Invoice/delivery note or any other step involved?) **c2) Buying from Local FZ Company Directly (can we? goods are already in mainland)** Simply issue order to local company and pay via your business bank/cheque and let them deliver to your chosen WH/FC. **(right?)** (does the ownership of goods transfer happen to you simply by executing this transaction of issuing PO/getting Invoice/delivery note or any other step involved?) in both above cases (c1 & c2), how do you make sure that the goods you are buying from are custom duty & Import VAT already paid? **2) Buying from a local company in mainland and selling to another local company in mainland:** Simply issue order to 1st company and pay via your business bank/cheque and let them deliver (or arrange delivery company) to 2nd company after obtaining PO from & submitting Invoice to 2nd company **(right?)** (does the ownership of goods transfer happen to you from 1st company and then from you to 2nd company simply by executing these transactions of issuing PO/getting Invoice/delivery note or any other step involved?) How do you make sure that the goods you are buying from 1st company are custom duty & Import VAT already paid?

1ej3ysj,I miss the old Namshi,1ej3ysj,Marco_rital,"Anyone here miss the old Namshi ? (Before the Noon acquisition). Among all the UAE companies, Namshi used to be my favorite. They had covered everything a customer needs: - A great customer support with great transparency - Fast delivery times and return policy - A good selection of *authentic* products - A very user-friendly app Since Noon has acquired them, it all went downhill. The customer service has become very bad, the delivery time has increased and there is no longer transparency (some items are shipped without notification or delivered after the due date. Some of them are out of stock and can only be delivered after 2 weeks, while it appeared in stock upon ordering) The app is a disaster, it’s laggy with a lot of bugs and I hate browsing on it. I have gradually stopped ordering through it but I think the last drop was my last purchase: brand new Adidas shoes that started to “peel” only 2 weeks after using it. I’m starting to doubt about the authenticity of the products now (I had zero doubt before the acquisition it was 100% genuine) Honestly, it’s a very good example of how ruining an amazing company and destroying everything that has been built over the year (including the customers’ trust) Does anyone feel the same way ?",72,2024-08-03 17:57:30,True,True,post

1gy5gs9,Bubee and Noon Self Pickup,1gy5gs9,raw_beeg,"So, I ordered 2 Orders at around the same time on noon to the same Bubee store due to the ongoing sale. Both the orders went through and the bubee vendor made the drinks and was telling me to press some pickup button or something like I was a delivery guy or something. I had to cancel because the guy at the shop was pressuring me to. Paid via Card and the chatbot of noon is shit and is just saying NO REFUND. Is there anyway I can get back my money (it's only like 20AED but money is money) TIA. PS; Like what do they do with the drinks they made, throw it away or give not so freshly made drinks to the next person who orders the same thing. No Offence to the staff at the shop but he couldn't understand what I was saying and he was just telling cancel and go I don't know ur problem etc. Kinda rude considering I'm a paying customer.

The order was tremendously late, upon his arrival I asked the delivery agent why he was late. Thank God I was not pissed off just tired and hungry so I asked him politely else I wouldn't have been able to forgive myself. To my surprise, he told me he is a walker not a rider (struggling with english). I took quite a while for me to process this and asked him repeatedly if that's what he means. He said I walk, don't ride. I asked company didn't give you bike? He said no. I asked you have bike riding license? He said no. Although I offered him some water and handed a can of barbican that I had available at the time, I still can't understand what just happened. Is he deceiving noon somehow or is it noon who is actually hiring these guys to deliver on foot? If so, this is as worst as child labour, how could MOHRE allow this?

Two weeks ago, a friend of mine who was working as a delivery rider for Noon was involved in a fatal car accident in Dubai. The accident occurred while he was on duty. He was hired by a third-party company, not directly by Noon. Now, the company he was employed by is denying the insurance claim related to his death. They have stated that they will only cover the vehicle insurance and not any claims related to his death. This has left his family in a very difficult situation, both emotionally and financially. I am seeking advice on how to proceed with claiming his insurance. What steps can be taken to ensure his family receives the support they are entitled to?

Bought it, and when the courier delivered my scooter, I gave him 1712 AED + 38 AED tip (that is what I thought) Turned out I had 1000 AED bills instead of 100 AED bills and I gave him 17050 instead of 1750 AED, so 15300 more. I didnt notice that because I was so exhausted. Next day I was looking for the money and I was nearly sure I must have lost it, maybe it felt out of my pocket etc. I gave up after 2 hours of searching the apartment. We had 7 big suitcases when we were moving to Dubai and we stayed in a hotel for 2 weeks so it was a mess and I was sure I just lost the money somehow. Next day the courier messaged me on Whatsapp and he told me that I gave him 17k. It is unbelievable for me. I am from Poland, there is no way anybody would write me admitting he got so much money. I wasnt even thinking I gave him that amount, so he informed me all by himself. Incredible guys, I dont know if he was scared I would report him or he is so honest but when I meet him and wanted to give him 300 AED tip I needed to nearly force him to get this tip. Crazy story 😅",3735,2024-10-20 13:04:47,True,True,post

Popped it into an envelope and handed it over to him a few days later to pay for some flooring work he had done. He must have counted it in his car because he came back after 5 minutes with our contract in hand, and pointed out my mistake. I double checked my safe and sure enough, I was down a few thousand more than I should have been. Once we settled up the correct amount I tried to offer him a tip but he refused and I had to instead insist on covering his petrol for coming back out to me.

You are taking an insane risk of money falling out of your pocket etc. At least keep it at home at all times and get familiar with the bill denominations. 2. Please search this sub for all the different types of scams prevalent in Dubai. There are many different types so you need to understand all of them in order not to fall for it. Different scans work in different ways so please familiarize yourself. Never trust a link in an SMS or a phone call from the ""police"" or the ""central bank"". \ You seem super naive and careless just based on this post so you will easily be a scamming victim. 3.

These terms are used when a person feels the need to correct or downplay someone else's good deed, often because they perceive it as being done for self-promotion or to gain social approval rather than out of genuine altruism. >Additionally, this could be linked to feelings of \*\*envy\*\* or \*\*insecurity\*\*, which may lead a person to criticize or undermine the good deed to protect their own self-esteem or avoid feeling inferior. Another related concept is \*\*moral licensing\*\*, where people might downplay others' actions to justify their own lack of similar behavior. /Chatgpt Not my words, you can take up your beef with ChatGPT if you wish.

But outside of this, in the real Dubai, I also have had several positive experiences. A good amount of people are honest here and they won’t take money which don’t belong to them. I have experienced similar cases when at one time I paid my real estate agent 20k instead of 10k and was locked out of the country for 4 months during COVID. When I came back 10k was returned. That said there have been a couple of scam attempts as well like the famous Armani scam. However, I did not fell for it as I too believe that if something doesn’t belong to me. I won’t take it.

1gdth1s,What happened to Namshi app?,1gdth1s,NinjaExorcist,"I heard they were bought by Noon, however a month ago I wanted to buy a pair of Adidas shoes as I found a good deal on their site; 30% off and for a limited time! Who'd refuse such deal. That day, I decided I will delay ordering it till evening only to find out that the app was broken, it had technical difficulties and was crashing.I got soooo pissed then the next day, I open the app and it's working fine but I had a gut feeling to delay ordering it to see what this technical issues are all about. I checked their instagram to find that many people were complaining of the same issue. I submitted a request to their support team on two different emails but with no luck. Till today the issues are still there; it would work for few hours then it would be crashing most of the time. What's strange is that, regardless of this issues on their app AND website, they are still advertising through social media account. I also still see their ads everywhere and with crazy discount prices. Like this one for Nike shoes, it was 56% off and sometimes I see shoes ads for 1% which is also weird. So I'm genuinely asking does anybody knows what's wrong with Namshi app? Is it still working? Has anyone faced a similar experience and tried to order but they have recieved their order anyways? At this point, I'm not willing to risk, cause I've already been scammed through shopping apps before. 🥲",0,2024-10-28 08:01:35,True,True,post

1gdth1s,What happened to Namshi app?,lub7ayd,BraveBanana404,"ok let me clear everything out as i work at Namshi. I moved form noon to namshi after it was aquired. \- The son of Mr Al abbar has nothing to do with namshi. he started a company that is called sivvi that was acquired by noon some 4-5 years ago \- Namshi was initially founded by Faraz, Hicham (current CEO and MD of noon) and a few other people backed by Rocket internet (german incubator company). \- Namsih exited by selling its shares slowly slowly to Emaar (which is owned by Mr al Abbar) \- Noon is founded by Mr al abbar and technically has nothing to do with Emaar. they just share Mr al abbar \- Namshi was later sold from emaar to noon. Now on the tech part and reliability issues: \- Namshi and noon share the same login credentials. So if you create a noon account you cna use the same one on namshi \- some of the backend stuff is shared across noon and namshi but not everything \- some tech glitches hence affect both namshi and noon \- there was a glitch a week or so ago that last for a few hours and was on and off which is whtat u/NinjaExorcist is probably referring to \- these downtimes are usually exceptions and in many cases are relevant to external serivices that we use \- in terms of return policy it is pretty open and verry rarely namshi asks any questions when people return things (not sure how long this will last) so make use of it \-refurnd typically happen wihtin 24hours from when the return is picked up \-delivery in UAE can happen in Same day if you order before around 1pm and roughly 98% of deliveries happen within the promissed time. \- in terms of pricing, alot of it is automated and hence you get heavy discounts and in some cases 1% discounts. The heavy discounts are all legit and its usually our liquidation and outlet inventory that we buy in order to discount and get customers \- all products are 100% authentic as we only buy directly on the brands \- some products will be available on both noon and namshi but that doesnt apply to all products.

1flckz5,Which is the Best Cashback Credit Card ?,1flckz5,dubaidirewolf,"Hello Folks, I’ve been using the FAB Visa Signature Credit Card for the past 8-9 years and was part of their accelerator program, which gave me reward points worth approx. 8% cashback monthly (with a cap of 500 AED per month - no matter where I make the spend). Recently, I received a message from FAB stating that they are discontinuing the accelerator benefits, and now I’m looking for advice from the community on the best cashback credit card out there. Here’s my typical monthly spending: • Groceries: 1500-2000 AED • Utility Bills (DEWA/Etisalat/Du): 1000 AED • Online Shopping (Noon/Amazon): 1500-2000 AED • School Fees: 1000-1500 AED I’ve done some research and found that certain cards offer good cashback on groceries, others on utilities, and some for online shopping. Ideally, I’d like a single card that offers the best overall cashback across these categories. Would appreciate any recommendations or experiences you have with cashback cards! Thanks in advance and have a great weekend. ——————message from bank——————— Dear customer, effective 15 November 2024, your Accelerator benefits will be discontinued. You will continue to enjoy your regular FAB Rewards benefits with exciting new features coming soon. Thank you for being a valued member of FAB Rewards. Stay tuned!

1flckz5,Which is the Best Cashback Credit Card ?,lo2q5jo,Ch4Rm0nY,I am not sure about the best cash back card but check ADCB 365 cashback credit card - I get around 500AED from it too. There are subtleties though - if I order food through careem it gives 1% as taxi. If through deliveroo - 6% like restaurant. But it is never 8% - there is no such category even. So probably it is worse than what you have. Anyway with drops of interest rates I guess banks will start to lower their cash back offerings too. So it is not a coincidence that your card got these discountings.,2,2024-09-20 20:43:12,False,False,comment

1gx0tjb,AC Units,1gx0tjb,Mickdxb,"Hello everyone, I'm seeking a split AC unit for my place and have been struggling to find one at a reasonable price—preferably on sale—that is also a recognisable brand. I've checked online retailers like Amazon and Noon, where I found many familiar brands, but I would prefer to purchase from a physical shop. This way, if any issues arise, I can address them directly without dealing with online retailers. If anyone knows of any reliable shops in Dubai, whether large ones like Sharaf DG or smaller, trustworthy mom-and-pop stores, that would be a great help. We’re moving next week, so I need to find something quickly for the maid’s room. Thank you!​​",1,2024-11-22 09:40:03,True,True,post

1g54pum,Noon Minutes Drivers ,1g54pum,CrispyChickenSkin237,"I order from Noon minutes on average twice a week, usually small orders with items I’ve forgotten on my grocery shops. Lately, almost every single order has been delayed (I don’t mind, I’m still getting it in under 30 minutes which is a blessing) but most of the time the driver marks it as “delivered” at the 12-13 minute mark, I’m assuming to avoid penalties. I know it’s a first world problem but it’s so annoying 😩 Sometimes I get a cool driver who will phone me to say he’s delayed and I tell him “don’t worry about it” But some drivers just lie and mark it as delivered 🤷🏻‍♀️ it’s annoying because I live in a huge complex and there have been occasions where my order has gone to the wrong tower. So when it says “delivered” I have to check that it’s there straight away. I go to my door, it’s not there, it’s already marked as delivered so I can no longer phone the driver to ask where he is, I contact support to ask where my order is, support sometimes gives me the driver’s number, I call him to ask, he says he’s on his way and begs me not to report him and now we’re all upset because I wasn’t going to report him, but just don’t lie 😭😭 Sorry, rant over!

While they were waiting, there was a drum of water that each one was taking from to quench their thirst. Not a water dispenser, just a blue drum. Not cold water, just a drum out in the open. It was a sad sight to see how hard these guys work, no matter all the rants of the way they drive, etc. Later in the day, I ordered some food, and saw these stats on Noon App. The rider to deliver my food had driven 263 kms delivering 32 orders, but just received 2 tips. That, imho, is another sorry state. The same app charges a service fee that we pay, but not the tip to a driver who rides in the heat? Is this an isolated case of a rider, or is tipping delivery riders just not a thing. Having been Dubai for long, tipping is definitely a norm though.

Positives: - no traffic in or out - 15 mins to motor city or Dubai Hills mall - easy drive to Abu Dhabi if you need to go for work - 5-10 mins to DIP for Lulu or Carrefour - very quiet community - metro station 5 mins walk - next to Expo which is great for walking in evenings in winter - masses of free overflow parking for 2nd car or visitors - strict building rules so no junk in corridors, kids causing nuisance - maintenance team on site to deal with any problems reasonably quickly - quiet park on site - no dogs allowed - decent pool for each cluster of buildings - delivery available from all the major apps Negatives: - only single small supermarket in community which is good for bits and bobs, but not main weekly shop - only single fried chicken shop in community - no coffeeshop - no pharmacy (though one due to open soon) - can feel a little remote and away from everything - rent is a little high for the area - no option to remove the provided furniture, which is a bit ‘corporate hotel’ in its style, rather than homely - security a bit overzealous at times - landlord will try to increase rent on renewal, even though Rera says zero increase allowed - delivery options can be a little limited compared to more central areas - construction noise from expo expansion - noise from events at expo (music festival) If you have any other question, feel free to DM and I’ll be happy to answer",8,2024-10-11 16:30:52,False,False,comment

Might be the center of everything in the future though... Who knows? Really could depend on how long you'll be staying. More variety of restaurants the closer you are to high-density or populated areas. Same for delivery services. You can use Google Earth to help in your research. If it is closest to your work, less than 20-minute drive or around 5km radius from your home, definitely consider! If it is closer to 30 or 45 minutes of driving or closer to 10km radius (or greater) from your home.... look into Furjan, Remram, JVC, JVT, etc... These areas are closer to the rest of Dubai. Yeah, they have some traffic if you are heading to or coming from the East parts of the city, but otherwise they have more restaurants, more facilities, etc... as they are already mostly developed with recent road & public transport improvements and probably ones planned in the future.",2,2024-10-11 15:02:18,False,False,comment

1fhbg1j,Noon terrible customer service,1fhbg1j,iambadatuser_names,"Looking for help from the community here, here it goes: I ordered a 55cm gas stove (as per product description image) from noon on the 25th of August according to the space in my kitchen which is slightly less than 60cm so the only logical choice is a 55cm (or less) stove. I was not at home as my wife had to go through an emergency c-section a day before so I gave the building security the key to let them keep it inside and install it. They sent a 60cm stove which did not fit the space obviously so instead of contacting me they left it *drumroll please* IN THE HALL IN FRONT OF THE TV. Once I got home, I contacted noon that their advertisement/product description was essentially wrong, which is why I ordered this product and therefore they need to arrange for return of this item. They said “ofcourse we are so sorry, this is a mistake on our part, we will fix it and someone will contact you for return”. They fixed the product description the same day, unfortunately I did not take a screenshot of the wrong ad as I thought it’s a straightforward issue that would be resolved as I was assured by the agent. Since then they keep saying “we sent the right item” essentially speaking like robots, repeating the same thing. Even a complain to DET hasn’t resulted in anything. It’s been 18 days without any solution. Can anyone help or has similar experience but with a positive result (read lots of similar experiences on Google with no positive outcomes) ??",35,2024-09-15 16:34:06,True,True,post

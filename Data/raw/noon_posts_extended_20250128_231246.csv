vqargm,Noon.com Return Experience,vqargm,mujtaba_mir,Horrible experience with Noon returns. Just returned a vacuum and air fryer unopened and as it was delivered and guess what? Woke up to both requests being declined because the items aren‚Äôt in original condition. Spoke to the agent who kept on repeating the items weren‚Äôt in the original state and will be delivered back to me. I have read a lot of horror stories here. Any pointers? Update 1: Someone from noon.com‚Äôs complaints team called me and assured me that they will make sure I get the refund. He looked at the return photos and agrees to what I said. For now the products will be resent to me and picked up soon for the refund. I will post an update here once done. Update 2: The items were delivered today but no return setup yet. The complaints team will set up the return as per their last communication. The item boxes are heavily wrapped. Update 3: Both items were picked up yesterday morning. No update yet. I have reassured that a refund will be done. Final Update: The refund was credited to my card yesterday. Sad it had to come to this but I will be sticking to amazon going forward.,74,2022-07-03 09:57:52,True,True,post,dubai
javqao,NOON.com SOLD ME FAKE ITEMS 3 TIMES in a row,javqao,popxa,"Will try to keep this long story short. One month ago (!) I bought disposable face masks 50pcs for my kiddo on Noon.com. That was a kind of special item, quite pricy but that was what I looked for. So, I got the shipment and was surprised to get a **COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ITEM** which has nothing in common with the listed one. For better understanding, the one I ordered was a colorful mask with camels and different Dubai landmarks printed on it and included special **SILICON EAR PROTECTORS**. It costed **AED 58,8 + delivery AED 10**! The delivered item was simple surgical-like PLAIN WHITE MASK without any prints and WITHOUT EAR PROTECTORS! Even no brand name. nothing. Later I saw this item in the pharmacy for 9 dirhams (!!! 9 AED). I called noon support to try to exchange this fake and was told it was a ‚Äú**mistake on the warehouse, sorry, sorry**‚Ä¶.‚Äù. Was assured that **I would get the right one if ordering again**. So, I did! For the fake I got a refund. And AGAIN, **SECOND TIME they sold me SAME FAKE ONE.** I raised complain 2nd time. For the next two weeks I spoke with maybe 6-7 different people, was told we ‚Äú**will investigate the matter**‚Äù, ‚Äú**will sort it out, sorry**‚Ä¶‚Äù, ‚Äúdon\`t worry, it is our mistake‚Äù and so on. I must say nobody showed the initiative in solving the issue, I had to push them every second day and all I heard was empty promises, same phrases, and no results. Then a lady called and told they have ‚Äúdouble checked‚Äù, **SHE PUT THE RIGHT ITEM ON MY SHOPPING CART**, and I could order, and **it would be the one I needed**. So, **I DID ORDERED 3RD TIME**! AND AHAHAHAHAHA **imagine what did they deliver????**. Same FAKE MASK. What a freaking mess this company is! BTW, that two times I returned the items they made a **refund of the amount minus the delivery charge**! This means they **sent the wrong item, confirmed the return, and deducted the delivery** thought it was 100% NOON mistake, not mine. I raised complain out of curiosity and they returned me these delivery charges. Just keep it in mind if you face same issues, guys! So, 3rd order delivered on Oct 1 and SINCE THAT TIME NOTHING HAPPENED. **I push them, they call me, promises smth but the problem wasn‚Äôt resolved. ((** I know, it does not worth it. Just out of curiosity! I wanted to buy a notebook last month. I am a customer; I want to buy what is listed and get FAKE items, NOON does not really try to resolve the issue and DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE AUTHENTICITY.",122,2020-10-14 10:52:27,True,True,post,dubai
1ewr4tx,DONT Buy Any Warranty Product from NOON.com,1ewr4tx,Particular-Ride-633,"i just faced very very bad experience with Noon.com. I had purchased Apple Renewed - iPhone 12 Pro Max from Noon with 1year Warranty. The Product grade was Premium (top rate) and when i start using it, i faced touch issue. and very soon its batter got swellen and screen came out. When i raised warranty Claim, initially they refused to cover under warranty, as as per them it was with 6months warranty, but since i had raised claim within 6month of period, they agree to take the phone for repair. They were kept delaying it and since delay, the screen which had come out due to battery swellen issue, it got crack and because of this crack reason, they found excuse and didnt repair the phone. I had shared the picture and video as initail stage and there was no crack, and since they took 6weeks to pick the phone, the batter swellen issue caused the damage in screen which they didnt repair, not even battery and returned the phone opened. i recommend everyone, DONOT buy anything from #noon other wise be ready to face such issues. they were very very unethical, unprofessional who knew that the phone issues are under warranty, phone is under warranty, still they tried their level best to make me fool that phone is not under warranty and cannot be repair and at last, they returned the phone opened.",1,2024-08-20 13:24:37,True,True,post,dubai

1cvwbpb,Harassment by Noon.com and it's return policy - May 2024,1cvwbpb,Disastrous_Note_5024,"UPDATE (20th of May 2024) I apologize for not paying close attention to Noon‚Äôs return policy. It is clearly stated that opened items cannot be refunded, as Noon cannot resell or return them afterward. Thank you for all the comments and to the Noon help center for clarifying this policy. This rule applies to returns in the UAE ///////////////////////////////////// Good day everyone, Following up on the problem discussed in post ""Harassment by Noon and it's return policy"", in which Noon refused to refund a customer for a product that doesn't fit, I'd like to tell my story with them. So, I ordered a Samsung S22 Ultra on the 11th of May at noon for AED 1,945. The product was delivered on the 17th of May, in the evening, with the box already damaged. This is not a major problem, however in context. After checking the phone in the evening of the same day, I examined it more closely and realised that it is not suited me as a gadget. I decided to return the product in the same condition as was (no scratches, no missing parts) - Photo 1 [Photo 1. Condition of the phone which I returned](https://preview.redd.it/4nuilqdunf1d1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=311fc845bbe9d8ddb871ddab357ed1d0f100293a) So I create a return request without any hindsight. Yes, I opened the box, but everything else was original. And I make the refund request the same day I received it (17th of May). The next day the courier picks up the phone and the request starts to be fulfilled - Photo 2 https://preview.redd.it/vz5w8pp70g1d1.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=d69690c51ab37e5848bd902c6cdcfa33443a8dac Today - 19 May - they send me a notification that the item cannot be returned because the box has already been opened. Every shop *(not really, I think only Amazon are being very nice about their returns policy right now, however they can't officially return opened goods either)* in the UAE is willing to refund If you have bill and do so within 15 days of purchase Noon refuse to me in this return - Photo 3 https://preview.redd.it/morgoa190g1d1.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=70ab57d4bdd0de10f22ec5c26d2121e3f54d904b As a result, product returned to me with no potential availability to reimburse money Generally it is rule of all stores, but in Europe usually it is a little bit different, that is why I thought the same rules applicable her * Amazon officially will not return product which is opened - however most of the case they agree to do it - [https://www.amazon.ae/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKM69DUUYKQWKWX7](https://www.amazon.ae/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKM69DUUYKQWKWX7) * Samsung, SharafDG, Jumbo does not allow to return opened product * Apple Store officially will return product in 15 days Be attentive during ordering expensive products, otherwise you will not be eligible for return.

w56wr6,noon.com used macbook pro with an already active warranty.,w56wr6,Bilallakhany,"Tldr: Received a pre activated used macbook pro from noon and can't even buy apple care on it plus the customer support days apple products on noon don't come with apple warranty when it literally says on the invoice that it has 1 year apple warranty. Hi, I ordered a macbook pro 2021 from Noon.com on the July 9th I got it on the 13th of July due to the eid holidays. After opening it and setting it up I went to check the warranty status to try and activate it but to my suprise it was already activated from 17th of June and the warranty had already started from the 18th of June. Also for some reason when I would try to buy apple care+ for it, it wouldn't let me saying the macbook was ineligible for it. I read some forums and found out that, it usually happens with macbooks that are sold from the display pieces section. I contacted Apple seeing as though maybe it was a glitch and they would update the purchase date to when I actually bought it but they told me that they can't change it because the product was already used and opened on the 18th and it was registered in their system. After going back and forth I was told to contact noon as it was an already used product. After calling noon I had the most frustrating experience in my life with one of their custom service agent. She said: buying apple products from noon means I can not go to apple in case something happens to my laptop and I can not buy apple care for it because it was bought from noon, I swear this is the most stupidest thing I've ever heard she kept on arguing and literally raised her voice saying that I can not go to apple if I buy an apple product from noon I would have to claim warranty from noon itself which is only available for one year. She also kept trying to convince me that it doesnt matter if my laptop is pre activated because noon is providing me warranty from the 13th of July the day I received my laptop which is the second most stupidest thing I've ever heard. Coincidentally I had actually purchased an iPhone 13 pro Max just a few weeks back from noon as well and I actually bought apple care for it too, it took me some time to remember this but soon as I did I told her that its not first time buying an apple product and nor is it my first time buying it from noon. I told her I bought an iPhone just a few weeks back for which I bought applecare as well and the warranty started exactly from the day I opened it no issues and apple care upgrade was instant as well. After listening to that and checking my order history if I had actually bought on iPhone or not she got speechless and told me she will transfer my call to refund department after that I was transferred 3 times just to reexplain the issue each time and finally I was told that they will register my complaint and reach out to me within 2 days and its been 1 week since I've heard back from them and if I try to follow up with them they just tell me to wait. Can you guys tell me what I should do in this case? Also for people who are wondering why I decided to buy it from noon is because I have a noon cashback card and I was bit greedy because of the cashback, I accept my mistake there. My sister got it from Amazon just a few days back the same model everything and its absolutely perfect no active warranty and apple care is also purchasable, I should've just waited to buy it from Amazon as it was out of stock at that point. Update: Noon has reached out to me and they have told me that it is certainly an issue on their part and it shouldn't have been pre activated in the first place, however they've asked a day to look into it and hopefully they'll get back to me by tomorrow.",25,2022-07-22 14:11:13,True,True,post,dubai
wta3fp,Noon.com delivered the damaged dishwasher and doesn't want to take it back.,wta3fp,MarcusDL,"Noon.com delivered the damaged dishwasher and doesn't want to take it back. Greetings everyone! I have a sad situation. Maybe someone has some advice for me. About 3 weeks ago, I ordered a dishwasher from [u/noondotcom](https://www.reddit.com/u/noondotcom/)\*\*.\*\*After the delivery (they are not giving connection service) and after the unboxing, I found that the item is damaged and opened a complaint. The item was marked as "" This item cannot be exchanged or returned "" but [u/noondotcom](https://www.reddit.com/u/noondotcom/) policies say that if the product has a manufacturing defect, the item can be returned with the original box, information booklet, and all other accessories. After I opened a complaint within a week, nobody contacted me and operators always repeated ""you need to wait for 24-48 hours and the manager will call you"". Only after I started sending messages to [u/noondotcom](https://www.reddit.com/u/noondotcom/) social networks, did they call and promised that they will arrange dishwasher pick up in 24-48 hours. It was 8 days ago. Since then, I had at least two more conversations with [u/noondotcom](https://www.reddit.com/u/noondotcom/) complaint department representatives, and every one of them promised pickup within 24-48 hours. The last time was yesterday with 100% promise that the return has been approved, and the item will be picked up maximum by Sunday evening. Now I received a call from [u/noondotcom](https://www.reddit.com/u/noondotcom/) with an offer to credit 1/3 of the item price to my noon wallet and keep the damaged item. Damage type (strong bump on one of the edges) means that the 24-month warranty for this item is voided. I refused it and received a new promise (guess what) to call within 24-48 hours. Call center representatives refuse to give office addresses to leave personal complaints, and refuse to transfer the call to anyone from managers or supervisors. Order number: NA\*\*\*\*\*\*\*10263 Complaints number: 168686538 - Opened August 1st. 169853406 - Call back request from my husband 10 days ago with no reaction.

dfolwr,Noon.com: Worse than Scamming Sites.,dfolwr,ghafri,"I don't know how can I say this. I don't even know where to begin. But my experience for the last 24 hours with noon was a total outrageous nightmare. To begin, here I am on a good morning driving to work suddenly my phone broke for some reason. I was expecting this day to happen but not today. I had this phone for around 5 years now and I knew I needed a newer phone. I went online and looked up the prices for a new phone on noon and I found a good phone to buy. I didn't know about the shady things that I learned today that is happening behind this site but only if I looked up the reviews behind noon. I would never in my life would have opened this site again. I would even have it blacklisted that if any of my family looked it up its gonna be blocked. Anyways I ordered this phone and the estimated delivery is going to be on 10th of October. Which is going to be tomorrow for the time I'm writing this. I received a confirmation few minutes later that its under process and few hours later I received that my order is 'Out on Delivery', great I said, it will come that day.. I said. Well, the problem is my phone is bricked and I cant contact or receive their messages. Therefore I tried to contact their 'online support chat' service and let me tell you this, to save your life from the nightmare. It was literally the worst kind of customer support chat that I ever in experienced in my life. As soon as you start the chat, expect yourself to stay with them for over 2 hours. Not because your discussing a topic or like trying to find a solution, but as soon as you start the conversation. Expect that the person that your speaking with will be in contact with approx. 1000 other people as well at the same time! I'm not even kidding! As I'm typing this I'm speaking to one right now and I asked a question at the beginning of this writing and guess what? They haven't replied yet. Well thankfully they replied now but guess what more, its another one of those robot replies that are literally not related to anything I asked. Imagine this, sitting on your computer, talking to a person that is taking a million calls at the same time and expect them to reply to you as your talking one to one? No, they literally don't care if you sit there and wait for them to reply, they don't care about your time at all, they don't care about your money that you have paid, they only care that they have fewer employees that take only chats which saves them a lot of money than hiring others and waste your time waiting for them to reply on something not related cause they focused on a different chat not related to yours and when they come back in the loop of 1000 other chats they already forgot what you were asking and use some kind of manual or automated system to reply to you with whatever. Time is money, noon doesn't care about your time, they care about saving their precious money. Do you think there are refunds if you perhaps cancel your order? Well guess what, you will get it in noon credits.. But why? If you checked their FAQ they don't have cash on delivery, only prepaid.. But Why? Because money. The answer is money, there is no other way to explain this chaos. As soon as you order and press that checkout button, say bye bye to your money. Its gone no matter what happens, no matter what you do, no matter how long you wait, no matter how frustrated you get, no matter what, you are a fool in their trap. I myself was a loyal customer to Souq, everything I bought was on Souq, I loved the site so much that I used it weekly and order on the same day and they ship it less than 6 hours. After it went [amazon.ae](https://amazon.ae) everything changed, its no longer Souq I know and love, I thought noon could be the one but today I understand that noon is just another legal scam site. I even had better customer chat support on actual illegal scam sites than this mess, its laughable to compare it to a scam site but its the truth. My truth perhaps, anywhere I go, any friends I meet and people I know that will ever speak about online shopping I'll give them an honest warning about this shady business and avoid it at all costs. It even says that its out on shipment since yesterday, why do I have to stay on my feet for over 24 hours waiting were have the delivery man gone? I checked the address of the seller, its 10 min from where I work, I could literally pick it up from their shop, why does it take so much time to deliver? Oh he told me he will be back with me in 1 minute. Its been 3 hours now with this online chat and hes repeating the same thing over and over again, but hopefully I could see how far I would go, living without a phone gives you so much free time on your hands knowing that you could get fired anytime from non received phone calls when someone like noon is not doing their job properly, replying with fake and empty copy pasta apologies that they probably have a 100 page handbook of apologies to use that are unique and variant and being at their mansion swimming in their money and counting it. Oh and don't forget to end it with 'Shukran', that's really important to entrust the customer with their apology. Someone would come and say, ""Why didn't you just buy it from a local shop like everyone else?"" My answer would be, I'm the fool here, I entrusted my exponential experience with Souq that I thought noon could surpass them, but today my vision was clearer than ever, I'll buy any electronic product only locally, because this site will never in a million years regain my trust, and I mean it. I cant even ask for a refund cause my money will go to their 'noon credit' unlike any other normal shop which will pay you back how you paid like normal beings. therefore, even if I buy a different phone ill have to use their credit which I will still face the same experience. I'm going to export the chat log by the end of this conversation to have look at my horrendous experience I had with noon support if you wanna spare some of your time reading it, it will take you an hour if your a fast reader so don't bother if you don't like to see another man suffer. Beware, the support guy English is level 1 so your going to see a lot of broken English that will not make any sense. Additional beware, if the question will critically harm their reputation that they are actually talking to other users than you at the same time they will try their best to dodge your question, I spent over an hour asking why were talking with other people and they constantly say they are talking to me only when they wont say about others because its true the are talking to me but every time I ask about others they give the same answer no matter what: "" I am sorry but I am with you only"" eventually they became stubborn and said they will give the same answer no matter what which confirms to me that they actually talk to other people and your question wont matter to them. If you would like to experience recent reviews such as mine, check out [https://www.trustpilot.com/review/noon.com?languages=en&stars=1](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/noon.com?languages=en&stars=1) or [https://www.reviews.io/company-reviews/store/noon-com](https://www.reviews.io/company-reviews/store/noon-com) If you check one of the links, they have an automatic reply bot that checks each reply or someone actually manually writes, they literally don't care but they try to show they do: ""Hi $first\_name, we are extremely sorry about the shopping experience you've had with us. We assure you that this isn't the experience we intend to provide. The concerned team has been advised to get you updated as soon as possible, If you're in need of any assistance, we are always here to help through any customer support channel. Shukran! "" I assure you if they see this post, I'm 100% certain they will say something along the lines of the above without actually addressing the situation at all. Please have a look at the above links and see that words of truth come from over 500 reviews of 1 start and 50 5 start.. Noon will get its precious money eventually, but will leave behind a trail of dishonesty, mistrust, mistreated, time waste to their angry and irritated customers. I haven't been this irritated as I am today since years now like someone literally held me at gun point, took my wallet, gave ma long speech before he left about random stuff that he read from a book and then left silently while the police are watching with money in their pockets. What a world to live in.. I really hope some legal action is taken against this type of behavior from online shopping services. Oh he finally replied since the last 1 minute, since how long has it been? 20 mins? they even disable the time on the chat so you don't feel that your losing time or even wasting it while they put u on hold to speak to the other 1000 people in-line. I lost hope already, I know my shipment will never arrive and I feel like calling the police at this point, but how will I do that? Jokes on me at this point. Please learn from my experience and consider buying from other online retailers and learn from other people experience, think twice before you buy from noon, don't fall like I did, don't waste your precious time like me. I'm taking my time writing my truth and only the truth here because I don't have anything else to do, no people to call, no family to know how they are doing, nothing in my hands without my phone that the support person said it will be delivered today. I lost all hope of ever finding peace after this experience with online shopping, specifically with noon. I'm not sure what time it is but I believe we have been talking for over 5 hours. He replied around 60 replies so far, so on average, every 10 min I'll receive a reply that is 99% unrelated. One more thing, the order now and get it next day or like 2 days from now is a scam. I ordered the phone on 8th of October and it said It's estimated to be delivered on 10th, then I went to the page to reorder again to see when will it be delivered at and this time it said it will be on the 9th.. its the same seller as well. It's just a marketing scheme to influence that your shipment will be at your doorstep as soon as possible but they literally will take their sweet time since you wont get back your money anyways. It makes perfect sense why would they take the risk to make all their shipments free. Total sacrifice of customer satisfaction to gain their trust implicitly for one thing, and you know what is? Yes, you guessed it, money. &#x200B; EDIT: chat log link: [https://justpaste.it/42fxo](https://justpaste.it/42fxo) Hope you enjoy my suffering for the past 5 hours.",6,2019-10-10 02:31:26,True,True,post,dubai

9lt7ht,"Noon.com: Too Big, Will Fail",9lt7ht,Welldoneboy,"I was looking for reviews about Noon.com and found this article: [Too Big, Will Fail](https://medium.com/@bader/noon-com-too-big-will-fail-d9b7efa179ae) This article is not intended to hurt the trademark of Noon or its shareholders. I do this review to let others avoid the mistakes and make eCommerce much better even without a one billion dollar in funds. Summary: Noon.com is an eCommerce website tries to compete with Amazon and its company Souq, and other eCommerce platforms in GCC and MENA. Noon has 1$ billion in funding, but the start of the company was complicated and delayed the launching date. When they announce it to the public, they hired many people and spent money but they could not start at exact time which gave me an indicator that they can not start because they thought it is big and hard to manage. You can not compete with Amazon within months. During the preparation to open the platform, they joined the bidding over Souq, but it was a smart decision to sell Souq to Amazon just to create a new monster for Noon. They (As Emaar) acquired JadoPado, and 51% of Namshi which is a mistake that no eCommerce company would do it. I think those decisions led the management to make many mistakes and failures, and leave Noon after a short period of time. (JadoPado Founder Resignation) Weakness: Noon is not weak right now, they have the power of money which can make everything easy. It will not last forever because the main competitor can hold his breath more than you. The most important thing now is to merge all eCommerce businesses in one platform or focus on one only. Marketing. Same old ways of marketing which I believe will not add any value to any business nowadays. Do you think targeting influencers‚Äô audience will create more revenue to you? What if the audience tried something before from this influencer and did not like it, do you think they will like his/her next offer from Noon? How to reach more people? Think again. It is easy, it is not only affiliation system and discount codes. There is a problem with reaching the customers. The way how it is presented to the public was wrong, and they can fix it now, but they must change the look and make it more attractive to customers and investors. Focus on the price. Reach more customers by providing something good, even if you do not have everything. The biggest mistake was to serve many countries at the same time without having the resources. They should start from Saudi Arabia first, then expand to UAE which I think it is in process now. How to Survive? The main reason of this article or review because of an interview with Mr. Mohammad AlAbbar with AlKhaleej newspaper that GCC governments should stand against big companies like Amazon. This is wrong to prevent big companies to be in the GCC, because it will lead for monopoly and limited players in the market to control the price as much as they want which already exist in other industries and sectors. To survive and kill the new big monster is to change the business model a little bit. An agreement with eBay will not help Noon to survive in this market. After a research I found that Noon is buying its own inventory and resell it to customers. If you can not produce, then do not buy it. I think they should not products and be responsible for delivery and shipping at the same time. We know that you have money, but they must let other companies make some profit in this market. They sell it at discount for Noon, but not that discount to let them cover the cost of handling, shipping, and delivery. Buying X Product, for Y% Discount, which is usually between 30% to 40% will not cover your cost from handling, shipping, and delivery. Select one need, and make profit from it. If you want to keep the same model of buying products and resell it, then you must create a new company for fulfillment, local delivery, and international shipping, but they decide to do it under Noon Umbrella. Create do not acquire. They labelled their company as a big company, create small companies instead of making it as department in your company. Second, If they want to be a middle man and be responsible about fulfillment which gives them a great margin, then make agreements with companies to register and use the platform instead of competing with those companies except if you want to buy them all. In addition, focus on Small businesses which are the main players in eCommerce, and they can add a value to Noon more than big companies. There are 20,000 small business registered in as an online eCommerce in Saudi Arabia alone. This mean they can add more than 500,000 product to your platform. Allow them to use Noon‚Äôs facilities as storage for small business and implement new Fulfillment Model for them. You will create a new monster from small companies to compete with the big monster. Third, Noon must take the advantage of online payments and create its own payment platform. Again Create, do not acquire. Make it public and let other people use it. When Amazon acquired Souq, they acquired a payment solution called PAYFORT. Noon must create a payment solutions platform that can help in transferring a region that uses cash more than online payments, which PayPal can not understand yet and led them to focus on other markets. Last thing, the user experience and User Interface have many mistakes. You are selling a product, and I do not need to see something about Pros and Cons, make your own review system, no need to bring reviews from other websites. I am coming to Noon to make a purchase, and leave the Pros and Cons to customer. It is like going to Toyota and the sales guys telling you Nissan is better in interior. Final words, I love Noon and its Founder, they have a vision to change, but I think they must do some changes a little bit.",0,2018-10-06 08:18:10,True,True,post,dubai

f59aio,What are your thoughts and experiences so far with Noon.com Vs Amazon?,f59aio,jes_li,"I just though i'd bring this up here after my experience with both platforms, after more than a year in the market. My thoughts: My initial thought was that since so much investment went into the creation of [noon.com](https://noon.com), and they came into the market a time when [Souq.com](https://Souq.com) was going through a complete rebranding to Amazon, then it's literally over for Souq/Amazon, because noon has come for their head. My experience: I made my very first purchase from [noon.com](https://noon.com) and they delivered the wrong product the next day! I chose the COD because i didn't trust them yet, and i didn't regret it! i ordered the 22lb mass tech, and they delivered the 7lb to me and still tried to charge me for the 22lb? I literally went off on them and made them understand that it's very shameful that they couldn't even get my order right on my very first purchase. Of course, i told them to take their stuff back! I was pretty pissed off because they messed up my plans of resuming my bodybuilding routine at the scheduled time.. I ordered the same thing from amazon, i received the correct thing a day earlier at a cheaper price, and the app was surprisingly very fast, i mean, i know it's Amazon, but i didn't expect such smoothness. My conclusion, irrespective of how much noon has pumped into this, i think they still got a lot of catching-up to do. I think they've got nothing on Amazon.. As much as i had high hopes for noon, and wanted to support them so bad especially being a local platform, my very first (and only) experience with them ruined all that.. So, what are y'all experiences with these two arch-rivals? Which of them do y'all consider the best, and why?",0,2020-02-17 18:14:11,True,True,post,dubai

dwrwkb,Noon.com supplying Preowned Apple Products i/o brand new ones,dwrwkb,mikaelaindxb,"I bought an iPhoneX from [Noon.com](https://Noon.com) a few months ago and I couldn't buy Apple Care because the phone has been activated for more than 90 days already! Also, there was a number already registered on iMessage which was very strange for a supposed brand new iPhone. After weeks of complaining and talking to Noon's customer service, they finally resolved the issue. I swore I would never buy another Apple product from Noon ever, but during the 11.11 sale, I saw a good deal on a Macbook Pro. The delivery was great, the item arrived a couple days early (11/12/19)! Things were off to a good start! However, when I tried to buy Apple Care +, Apple said that the device is already covered by Apple Care+ (which was very strange) I called Apple customer service and they confirmed that the device has already been activated on 10/17/2019 AND already registered under Apple Care+ on 10.17.10 (i have an official email from Apple stating this, btw) which can only mean that this macbook pro is preowned (because why would a reseller buy AC+ for a macbook they were planning on reselling?! This is kinda disturbing because this has happened to me personally TWICE already (in a span of a few months!). I have written to [Noon.com](https://noon.com/) about this on 11.12 and until now, I have not received a reply! Update: I tried to update the OS to Catalina and now I cant even use the Macbook Pro, apparently there's an issue with the Startup disk according to Apple Customer Support! Update as of 11.16.19 Samer of Noon.com reached out to me last night and is sorting all of this out for me. Now, it looks like Noon.com will be bringing me a replacement by tonight! I must say, this is such a great improvement from my last experience with Noon.com. Thank you guys! :) Update as of 11.17.19 (1 am): The replacement Macbook Pro was delivered on 11.16.19 as promised!

I don't know if the seller sold a fake item, or somewhere on delivery it was replaced, I honestly don't know, I want my money back. &#x200B; EDIT: UPDATE: Comment from callmate u/myauntylovesyou the seller from Noon. I'd like to thank you for reaching out and explaining this. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ this likely seems the case for the phone being replaced by another customer who may have placed an order before you. So how noon express items work is, we deliver bulk quantities (think 3-400pcs) of phones every few days to noon. This is done to improve the shipment duration it takes for the phone to reach customers, as they are all already stored in the noon warehouse. Noon has various quality checks to determine if the product is eligible to be sold or not. From that point the logistics are under their control as the goods are handed over. What may have been the case, and has happened a few times too is, a customer may have placed an order, replaced the phone and returned it back for a refund, doing a good job of resealing the phone to claim it has never been opened. Noon will then place it back into our inventory and ship the order to another customer who placed the order, that customer being you. Although this is very much out of our control, i would like to apologize for the inconvenience, and i realize how absurd it may be to open a seemingly sealed phone for a gift to be a fake. I would like to offer you to visit out office and pick out your choice of phone having checked the condition before buying, would also attach a minor discount ( - the commission taken by noon). I can assure you our phones are professionally treated and are new. Also would like to inform that the reason for the chinese writings on the box is because of the phone being a Taiwan import, as they come with the Snapdragon processors which is considered better than the Exynos variant. I would also like to attach a few pictures that i asked one of our employees to send of a phone in our stock currently. Just to show the packaging/condition of our phones as they are delivered to noon.

Once they've pick up the phone for return, they will proceed with the refund right away. Thank you everyone for the help and tips, as for the seller, they sell real items, but they've been victims of these scammers too, who replace the phones, seal them back and return to Noon Express, where end buyers like me receive them eventually.

( It is behind a paywall that I couldn't crack). This brilliant business journo Harveen Ahluwalia's story outlines how our smartphones have become the super app and how it resulted in this whole smart-app discourse getting derailed now. The story is about a high-investment ( upward of a billion $ from VCs like SoftBank, etc.) attempt to build a super app in the style of WeChat, Line, etc., that eventually failed. For the contest, Botim is making a similar attempt here. Let's look at the other super app play relevant to Dubai. Gojek, the Indonesian app, cracked this code to make people consume a lot of services within their platform. Supposedly, the first Unicorn from Indonesia eventually became a decacorn. The founder, Nadeim, a Harvard grad and McK alumni, even became a Minister of education and technology in Indonesia. A fun fact is that they had their entire tech, product, growth, marketing etc in India. Flights from Delhi/Bangalore to Indonesia are always filled with Gojek employees. They turned into a super app by around 2016 with many services offered to the users who used bike-taxi and cab services, becoming this one-place-for-all app. I observed high adoption for this product when I visited Indonesia. They went public. But here's the catch. They had to merge the business with Tokopedia, the noon equivalent of Indonesia, to go to IPO. [They opened at IDR 442 on 14th April 2022 and are currently trading at IDR52. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOTO.JK/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIFOSY1H7XMk3yZiPGfwEA2h0MSll_1zv4qKIMzP5Ye_FYUmPdlM2plICNoE3Hfv2xM9Det6TfTmw7ZHH0cTi8kPiFdaRsUeTcnufUuOlPZWpE9sAmRUDrjYLFCk0me9nX0IP62AQcpSfAa2--Un56jeKmO0vCVqb6mTMaeFMGL6) Many have attempted to clone this across the world and mostly have failed so far There are a lot of attempts to crack this play in UAE by botim ( following the WeChat & Line model), smiles and many others. However, Careem is making one prominent attempt. Careem split only this business from Uber to become an independent entity, with Uber retaining a stake and Etisalat investing in the business for equity. For Careem, this model is a straight fit since Gojek also originated from Cab hailing. So, it is a pixel-to-pixel and ppt slide to ppt slide clone. They have experience in doing 100% cloning earlier when they cloned Ola, the Indian cam aggregator's business model, app etc and ended up winning. I also heard that the whole product was built in Bangalore. ( Not taking the credit away.... full marks for execution, and So the guess is that they are masters of cloning. The super apps idea worked for Gojek because it was relevant in an era when, way back in 2014, it was difficult to add and store a payment card in an app, and the devices also lacked space for many apps. Their share trading at only 13% of their IPO launch value validates this truth. So, what is the future for UAE's super apps? Can they beat the conclusion derived from past performance data in different regions? But the most relevant conclusion is what the story I mentioned outlined - **SmartPhone is the super app now** - What is your opinion on this ? PS: I don't want to undermine Careem's mammoth execution capability. I wish them good luck, but from what I have observed, they may be finding it extremely difficult to crack this code.",8,2024-08-21 11:00:06,True,True,post,dubai
17r6u0w,"Noon... seriously, what the .... H E double hockey sticks!?",17r6u0w,thatnoodleschick,"Things are always good when things are good, but man... Noon is so infuriating. They say ""we'll pick up your return in 48 hrs!"" It's 96 hrs, no pick up. Then they say, ""I see you've opened a complaint, we'll make sure to get back to you in 30 hours."" I say, ""can I speak with a supervisor?"" They say ""ok, no problem! One will call you back in 24 hrs!"" How is this service? It's always so hard to trust small businesses, but this is a national company. Now it's so hard to trust companies with no international presence. I guess I have to restrict myself to ordering only from Amazon. I've never had an experience so terrible with them. Noon is behaving like a shady little back alley pop up, instead of a legitimate business. If only my wishes could come true; I'd seriously waste one to shut noon down. I hate when it's merchandise that's low priced, because does one really complain about a loss of 95 dirhams and free shipping? It's not even the money, it's really the principle. Those who are never held accountable, never behave with principles. Update: Noon.com actually reached out to me because of this post! I'm surprised, because I just posted to vent and complain. I had to send the return reference number, but I was contacted by Smeha and she did for me in 18 minutes what no one else could do for me in 4 days. I'm truly appreciative of her help.",47,2023-11-09 10:27:13,True,True,post,dubai

hrszsw,"PSA for UAE gamers (and people in general, I s'pose): Avoid shopping from Sharaf DG. Especially online orders.",hrszsw,kreddit007,"**TL;DR: Sharaf DG's online store charged me for a game that wasn't in stock, taking several days to process my order.** **They then sold me the wrong version, not once apologising for their goof-up.** **Only after incessant follow-ups did they properly respond - and, realising their mistake, changed their website immediately to make it seem like** ***I'd messed up***. This is gonna be a long one - but after my experience - I'd advise you to stick to Amazon and Noon for your online shopping needs. Sharaf DG just haven't figured it out, unfortunately. I should've heeded the warnings: ""unbelievable service. Never ever I will buy something from you again and will tell all my friends not to do it."" ""I was surprised when i came to know that what happened with me is repeating with all customers, selling out of stock items, mislead customers with dilevery time, give false execuses and promisses,misleading information, then cancell the order, and returing the money late... "" # Typos aside, the second complaint nails it. # Thought I'd bagged a bargain when I noticed Sharaf DG was advertising ""God Of War Day One Edition"" for AED 39. For context, GOW DOE has different (better IMO,) box art and extra in-game content. Put simply - at AED 39, I got more bang for my buck with this deal. Here's what was on their website on 5th July, when I bought the game. (I only took the screenshot on the 14th, when emailing them to prove my point.) [God Of War Day One Edition for AED 39. A steal? Not quite...](https://preview.redd.it/lgndwulxy1b51.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6288f8b0212741b82edc593fd9ba26a492d97d3c) And here's the ""regular"" God Of War going for AED 100 on the marketplace. [Sold on Sharaf DG's 'Marketplace', where consumers put up their goods for sale. ](https://preview.redd.it/ieloftbha2b51.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dd31773a68413a89492842efe98a83cfa20fb90) I paid by credit card. They charged me immediately. *It took 3 days to process* the order. When I started tweeting them on the third day, payment was suddenly processed, and I was informed to collect the game from their Ibn Battuta branch - I'd opted for in-store pickup. 8th July. Here's my mistake: I should have been more alert upon collection; I didn't inspect the game properly. I only realised it was the regular ""God Of War"" (the wrong version) after inserting the disk in my PS4 Pro. Realising the error, I rushed back to Ibn Battuta to return the game. The customer care member insisted I was sold the right version of the game - despite my proving to him otherwise. Whilst the bar-code stated ""God Of War Day One Edition"", it was just a regular copy. I was told to email Sharaf DG support. So I did. The next day (9th July), I was told that Sharaf DG would treat my case on a priority basis, and get in touch with me once GOW DOE would be available in stock. To their credit, someone did call me an hour later, and (after figuring out the situation) promised to deliver the correct version of the game to me - considering I'd made 1 trip to return the game. They also assured me not to worry... I didn't receive any updates from them for the next few days. After several long tweets, agonising phone calls and a couple of emails - they still didn't respond - so I decided to ask for a refund from their Ibn Battuta branch (13th July). That same night, I checked their website once more. Turns out...GOW DOE was back in stock! Peeved, I wrote to them for an explanation. They wrote back (14th July) saying that I'd agreed for a refund, and that the case was closed. I, however, was still disappointed that Sharaf DG was certain they were selling me the right product. So I tweeted. I tweeted them the entire chain of events. Today (15th July) they come back with an email from the vendor stating that both versions of God Of War are the same. I know the vendor is wrong. Sharaf DG is of course, just a messenger in this scenario. # But guess what? I check Sharaf DG's website again...and they've magically updated the product I originally bought with a different description and image! [Lo and behold! The same product advertised earlier, with different details. ](https://preview.redd.it/uihep8drb2b51.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=29daa13598e14267963b23aab6af5a0d51ee65e1) Now that I've applied for a refund, I hope my money is returned within 7 days - 20th July. I do not want to chase them any more than I already have. Lessons learnt? Sharaf DG: 1. Sold a product that wasn't in stock. 2. Took days to process payment. 3. Did not recognise their mistake. 4. Did not apologise for their mistake. 5. Slacked when it came to sharing updates. 6. Immediately covered up their error upon realising they were caught. If you hop on [Sharaf DG's Twitter](https://twitter.com/sharafdg?lang=en), you'll see they're being butchered by customers left, right and centre. You'll probably find my tweets too. Take it from me, who had the time and patience to chase them, and call them out. If you're thinking to shop online from Sharaf DG, think again... **EDIT 1: Sharaf DG have blocked me on Twitter after I asked why they changed their product description and image for** [""God Of War Day One Edition""](https://uae.sharafdg.com/product/ps4-god-of-war-day-one-edition-game/)**.** **The price has also been increased from AED 39 to AED 78. I have emailed them to remind them about refunding my money on time. They promised 20th July - after I visited their store on 13th July.** **However, I only received an SMS stating a refund would be done within 7-10 business days on 16th July. Time will tell if Sharaf DG act responsibly...**",192,2020-07-15 22:25:28,True,True,post,dubai

yqslkc,Thinking about an ecomm business? Here are the ultimate steps you need to talk!,yqslkc,iaskwrongquestions,"Writing this post took me a while, but I finally found the time during working hours because why not! 2020 as the year was defined by covid, job losses, salary cuts and people suffering daily. The same year for me was different; my wife and I had our first baby. It was a blessing and a huge responsibility. That said, one day, I received an email from my company telling me salary cuts were coming, and I got apprehensive. I have a tiny baby to take care of, and I can‚Äôt rely on one income in a city known for being expensive. Going back home is not an option. Here is get a salary, and I spend it all back home with no income and no safety. So I need to find a better solution. Finding a new job was virtually impossible. People are getting fired, so how can I find a job? So I decided to open an ecom business! At first, I considered drop shopping, but after reading too much into it, I realized it won‚Äôt work here. The lead time, working with ‚Äúvirtual products‚Äù,. It will work based on ad spending. Then I decided I‚Äôll launch my own brand for something I‚Äôm passionate about, and here are the steps I‚Äôve taken: Legal status: Visited DED Tajer website, registered my business, and linked it to an Instagram account (the business account). Cost me AED 1600, and it was an immediate process. You get this paper; you are a legit business. Few points: 1) Please note General Trading is only open to locals and GCC residents. Hence, it would help if you were wise when selecting your business type. 2) There are 10000 options; please read into options, and use the search feature to be sure about what you select. 3) Whatever you select ‚Äúmay‚Äù affect your banking situation 4) Note: DED Tajer now transfers you to a new website called Invest in Dubai. It‚Äôs the same process but a more user-friendly website. BEFORE YOU PRESS PAY: You need a name. This was one of the most challenging exercises I‚Äôve done. Here is what I have done: Naming exercise: Found a Latin dictionary and started with the exciting letters: Z/V/X/Y/W/O/Q until I landed on a couple of nice ‚Äúwords‚Äù that meant something I could work with I opened up Google and searched those names; owning the brand and title is essential, so I opted for the least used one! Domain and hosting: Went to bluehost.com registered the domain (it was a mistake, I should have done it with Google or Shopify). It cost me $ 297.84 for 5 years. I thought it was a good deal back then. Consumer touch points: visited Gmail, booked my email, and immediately created FB/TW/IG and TT accounts! Those are the key channels to promote your business (Costs = zero) Platforms: Ecomm I‚Äôve decided on Shopify, there are plenty of alternatives, but Shopify is the Toyota of ecom platforms. Reliable, good support and an overall better ecosystem with plenty of developers working on it. I selected the basic option and paid annually to save up ($ 252). I was committed to trying for at least a year. Here are other options you can explore: 1) WooCommerce by WordPress 2) Packman 3) https://zid.sa (Saudi based company) Now, I need a brand! I went and hired a designer from Upwork. He was from an east European country. Very flexible and understanding. He captured my vision. I wanted something separate from my product. Something can someday grow into a generic brand. This cost me $200! Banking Solutions: Now, I started putting together the website, and I realized I need a payment gateway and a bank account; here is what happened: Looked up ALL UAE banks that offer any solutions for SMEs (Zero balance with a debit card and chequebook) using DED License, and here are the banks: 1) RAK Bank: RAKstarter SME Account ((Zero balance and 200 AED per month)) 2) CBD Starter Zero balance account in the UAE for all startups and entrepreneurs (200AED fees) 3) Mashreq NEO Biz (Zero balance and 200 AED per month) 4) Dubai Islamic Bank e-Trader Business Account (No minimum balance criteria) fees waived for the first year, then 1700AED annually 5) Emirates Islamic E-trader: only for GCC and UAE Citizens (Only 3K minimum balance or 200AED if it falls under 3K) 6) Wio Bank . Question: How I selected a bank? Answer: Well, I applied to all those guys, and the first to engage was my selection! They all have the same features, as you can see. RAK was the first to respond then I signed up with them. WIO is now my bank, as they offered zero fees for life during their launch campaign and moved my account there. Payment Gateway: Payment gateway is an essential part of the process; the UAE has plenty of options; I‚Äôd always vote for Stripe. It works perfectly with Shopify and, most importantly, integrates with it, but here are other options you can explore: 1) Telr (Weird system from 1998) 2) MyFatoora (clunky app but actually works and offers Apple Pay!) 3) Network International (more for big boys) 4) Noon Pay (Lousy team) 5) AmazonPay (very expensive!) Delivery and shipping: For local shipping, I work with Shipa, an excellent ground team, and horrible office staff literally; their business exploded in COVID, and they stopped caring about small guys like me (and probably you) GLOBAL Shipping: DHL. Very expensive, but damn, they are fast! Website design: Don‚Äôt reinvent the wheel; get an excellent template from the Shopify market (bank to the Ecosystem), edit, and add your photos, and you have a pro website! Products: You have plenty of ways to get suppliers, but if you are at step 8 without samples, dude, you seriously messed it up! Hire an SEO team from Upwork; this is an important step Launch on social! Push ads (don‚Äôt overspend, remember Noon and Amazon and eating up small fishes like me and you, so seriously, be savvy about your media spend Wait for your first sale! Extra tips: ‚Ä¢ Learn to take photos of your products ‚Ä¢ invest in a good DSLR ‚Ä¢ light ‚Ä¢ some backgrounds ‚Ä¢ adobe and canva license ‚Ä¢ Learn accounting ‚Ä¢ Pricing is critical; you need to master that art",34,2022-11-09 23:17:55,True,True,post,dubai
yxqorm,Noon has become synonymous with the word 'scam',yxqorm,LiquidPersonator,"So, another Noon victim here. To summarize my story: I have ordered an item on the 3rd of November, i paid AED10 delivery fee and was promised to receive the item on the 5th. After a lot of time and effort wasted following up with noon and them promising me the item will be delivered ""on time"" (ironically that was after the original delivery date has passed), the item finally arrived on the 9th. To my shock the item delivered was not what i have ordered!! Then the second part of the struggle started, trying to return the item. First i lodged a complain with customer service. They promised to pickup the item the next day and refund me within 5 days. Nobody came the next day. I called again, they promised to pickup the returned item on the 11th, but also nobody came nor contacted me on the 11th! The same on the 12th, the 13th and the same on the 14th. Finally i had to travel on the 15th and I'm not at home to hand over the returned item. Till this day noon hasn't given me back my money after a two week struggle!! screw shopping online if i'm going to struggle for two weeks everytime i make an order! What a nightmare! Going to tag [u/noondotcom](https://www.reddit.com/u/noondotcom/) here, even though i'm pretty sure nothing will come out of it. Update #1: Noon reached out to me here on reddit and promised to issue the refund to my account. Update #2: I have received today my refund, excluding the shipping cost. Sent noon a message to check why",65,2022-11-17 17:45:10,True,True,post,dubai

a0sy2k,TL;DR - iPhone with Facetime works perfectly fine with e-Sim from Etisalat,a0sy2k,c0ldphr34k,"Hi r/dubai, A few days ago I had posted this thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/9zg55f/nonuae_iphone_xsxs_max_is_your_phone_working_with/) asking whether anyone had experience about using e-sim from Etisalat on an iPhone XS Max which is a US/Canada version (model A1921). Got some responses on it that friends have done across du/Etisalat/virgin. so below is my experience about the same. &#x200B; **Part 1: The Fear** When you approach the store to get a token and tell them that you want to convert the sim to e-sim, the guy at the counter will ask you whether you have purchased the device in UAE. While, technically, I have purchased the device in UAE, it's not a TRA compliant model; you can read about models that exist for UAE [here](https://www.techwalls.com/iphone-xs-max-model-number-a1921-a2101-a2102-a2104-differences/). You say that this a locally purchased device i.e. on [noon.com](https://noon.com) or [souq.com](https://souq.com), what they fail to check is the model number. You get the token and wait for your turn. Once you are seated with the executive he/she will again ask you whether it's a phone bought in UAE, you nod, yes and then he/she says that how phones not bought from here are facing some issue with getting the e-sim done. You are sceptical now about what if, it renders the phone useless or rather add another headache of formatting it or not? &#x200B; This is how they make you afraid of falling in line. &#x200B; **Part 2: The Act** So I sit down with the executive and they start the process with taking the emirates id and all, double checking that firmware is iOS12.1 and the phone has Etisalat app since the QR code for the e-sim is generated in the app. Here you need another phone too so that you can take a picture of that QR code, so that your e-sim iPhone can scan it. Initially, the scanning wasn't going through, with the physical sim inside, it was giving error continuously that the plan isn't for this device. The executive went around asking for what to do, she seemed new. Now the important part, any other agent, who is seasoned, would have gone ahead checked your phone model and said that this phone isn't compatible and blah blah. Since, this one wasn't well aware of the process to reject such phones, the executive removed the physical sim, connected to the store wifi, scanned the code & viola, it worked. However, once connected and going through the on-boarding of the e-sim, I got a pop-up notification that this cellular plan isn't compatible with the model of the phone and might affect performance. Nothing to do here but click 'OK' & move ahead. &#x200B; **Part 3: The Conquest** Finally, the plan worked perfectly, inserted another sim and both are working great. Haven't noticed any performance issues or battery drains. Will check over this week and update. It, however, did take an awful lot amount of time to get the iMessages and Facetime activated on the number which I was previously using. Post the dual sim, you have to select your primary number which will be used for iMessages and Facetime. Finally what worked is that, I switched off the iMessage and facetime toggle, reset the network settings, restarted the phone, toggled the iMessage and Facetime again, & kept getting the message, 'waiting for activation' and left it on the side table for the night connected to wifi. &#x200B; In the morning when I checked, both iMessages and Facetime were working perfectly fine! So Hurray to that too! Just in case, your e-sim doesn't go through, the most discomfort would be asking the agent to reissue the physical sim. However, I advise you to finish the set-up in the store itself, in some cases, they say that it would take an hour to connect and all, is plain bullshit. Don't fall for it. At max, go to a store in the mall so that, even if they push you out saying it will take an hour, you can always go back and get it reverted, in case it doesn't. &#x200B; Let me know your experience about e-sim or update with similar across other networks. Also, it was AED 26.25 for this.

I had to drop the call and call again inorder to get another customer agent where I got.The second agent told me that she has opened a case and the department which such situations will call me after 72 hrs.I waited without getting any call I decided to call again and this time round even the second agent didn‚Äôt open a case so I had to explain my situation all over again where she did open the case and told me the right department will contact you shortly.the same day the department from I think noon care ecommerce contacted me and they told me to email them with photos and vedios of the damaged item for their approval.I did so sent everything but I kept receiving the same reverts on my email as if my case is not in their system.I became frustrated..I called the customer care again they transferred me to the department whch handles the situation where they told me the best they can do is I contact the warranty service team who will fix the issue.I told them why should I be the one contacting them instead of you.The lady was so disrespectful and rude.She transferred me to the warranty team‚Ä¶now this is 20 minutes of being transferred to different people(4 departments actually).Then I spoke to the warranty team where they said they cannot fix the issue because the issue is coming from the service team which is noon‚Ä¶So there the ones to fix the issue‚Ä¶or rather if I want them to fix I have to pay the charges.How can I pay for the thing I haven‚Äôt damaged.I called the customer service team again and I told them the warranty team said they can‚Äôt fix and the issue is from noon side and at this time I requested for a refund and a return of the item.They told me they will raise a case again‚Ä¶And it will take 72hrs‚Ä¶All this time I haven‚Äôt get any help whatsoever..It has been hectic explaining myself all over again and again without getting any positive help.The customer service of noon is very pathetic where they really don‚Äôt care to a point where one agent was so rude.Escalation departments are also of no help everytime I have to wait for same hours.Kindly resolve my issue I need a refund and return of this item.Because how can I be with a damaged thing from your side,2,2023-11-26 02:49:59,True,True,post,dubai

I'm not looking for apps that inform you of weekly offers or coupons etc but more like a sudden drop in price for specific items. I'm also aware of warehouse stores that have huge discounts but it takes time to find good gems in them so even groups that informs of a specific items in a specific discount store would be great. Would be also great if the group informs about special offers at restaurants and tourist attractions that run for a limited time. I know these groups exist in other countries that I've lived in so was wondering if there's something like that in Dubai/ UAE.,2,2023-09-02 13:59:44,True,True,post,dubai

This issue is going front and back and noon is not taking any stand on it. Ideally , the mobile should be activated from the day i received it . Instead its activated much before i purchased , it seems like i received a used product in the name of brand new . Noon has to take this case responsibly and provide the support to sort out this issue.

c9pxky,Rant: Noon fulfilled items,c9pxky,curionion,"The two times I ordered iPad pro from noon, got unhappy results. Both were with a ""noon now"" tag. First iPad Pro 11"" wifi, received it fast the next day, wrapped in 'noon seal', turns out to be kinda new (IDK), but when I turned it on, the item is defective with a 3cm very faint mark in the middle of the screen, becomes visible much when you crank up brightness above 50%. I returned it the next day. Money refunded in noon credits. Second iPad pro 12.9 inch 4G I bought after 2 weeks, seemed to be a used unit, yet advertised as 100% original and genuine. Still 'noon sealed', looking good until I found glue residue on the glass border which is about 1mm deep into the frame, in the corner with sim tray - a sign of screen repair, and a scratch beside that sim tray hole. Returned it the same day I opened it. The payment this time was from noon credits and extra charge from the credit card. Refund happened after 3 days I suppose, in noon credits again. Then I want to get my money back to my bank account as this loss of trust makes it unbearable to spend any more shopping on this site. Ooh uh, there was no withdraw option. Talked to the cs, the lady said she would raise my request to their team and it would take 14-30 days to process, and to the card that you used only. I mean, haha what. On souq and amazon, we users had an option to transfer those back to our other accounts and it will take a maximum of 7-14 days. What a joke!! [noon.com](https://noon.com) edit1: I just remembered there was one time I ordered a vase. No protective foam, but in a plastic wrap and they put it lying horizontally on the bottom of the box with other items. Very nice packaging, noon. What I got on my hands in a completely shattered one. edit2: Received a mail from noon cs 1hr after this post, saying I can put my bank details now as there's a change in refund mode. I guess they are active here. edit3: Got a message from u/noondotcom to follow up the cause. Let's wait, guys. edit4: A call from cs center just now @3:30 pm Jul-6. So they refunded me the amount paid through credit card the 2nd time, the one I had from the first return is still in the noon credits. Reason explained for my situation is that they received it 'that way' from the sellers and cannot open for a check. And they propose a good deal if a similar item could be found from the sellers and in case I'm still interested in the product, or else the refund process will still go on. So we are giving each other a 24hr time to see a good end out of noon shopping experience. I'm trying to keep their image positive now. To add more, after the first iPad return, I got a NOONCS coupon of 50 dirhams as an apology and bought a 2nd gen pencil. It's been okay so far. edit5: @6:30 pm Jul-6, I received a phone call from noon, mentioning the favorable offer that they could find and want me to check it out after reassuring the product is brand new (It's not a 'noon now' this time). Noon also gave me 100 dirhams credit to my account as a compensation. After all the hassles, I might get this iPad as I still have much balance left from the first return in noon credits and want to use them up. Basically, I couldn't utilize the coupon earlier: It was 200 (WEEKEND) / 150 (BIGMOB) off, now it's 100 dirhams credit. Compensation was 50 last time and now is 100, this seems a sweet spot. I anticipate a 100% happy shopping this time. Will post a last update after getting the tablet. last edit: I ordered it from the seller they suggested. It is sealed and activated on the date of purchase, valid through Jul-9, 2020. Almost no appearance flaw as a used unit but for the known bending issue out of the box. It is still a ref unit though, I later found a slight mark on the glass (0.5cm) it doesn't affect the viewing and only shows in some angles when the screen is off. I might keep the device this time as the bend is kinda slight and so many hassles till now. Noon called me to follow up if I'm happy with the iPad and services after 2 days of purchase. TLDR: I've lost trust in their sketchy business. No quality guaranteed from third-party sellers. Noon PR team is fast and responsive when it comes here. I hope they will take the customers serious and the sellers more serious. There should be an added section for product condition: new, like new or used. 'Noon now' items should and must fulfill how they deserve that tag: quality and originality, if they want to step up their games with amazon now.

n9tqic,Noon's BS warranty policy?,n9tqic,Sorry_Entrepreneur_9,"First (mostly unrelated and resolved) part: https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/mveic5/psa_check_the_charger_and_accessories_you_get/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share TL;DR: Phone screen splitting from the body. Noon says it isn't covered under warranty and tells me to fix it myself. I ordered an HTC 10 a few weeks ago, and the phone was all ok until 3 days ago. I noticed a light shining under the screen and upon a closer look, it turned out there was a tiny gap between the LCD screen and the body of the phone. Ok, I thought, time for a warranty claim. I filed a claim yesterday and today a person calls me asking me to explain the problem. I explain, and they say instantly that that isn't covered(?!). I asked what IS covered under warranty and apparently it's just when the screen or touch stops working or whatever. I asked them what I can do, and they told me to 'try and get it fixed by the manufacturer'. The product page clearly states ""manufacturer warranty"". The screen splitting isn't caused by the user, it's caused by either an expanding battery or the glue being removed somehow. Neither of which I've done. I'm sick of this BS warranty policy where damage isn't covered??? Like you sold me a phone that now turns out to be damaged, and have the audacity to tell me to get it fixed somewhere else? So, what do I do, r/Dubai and u/noondotcom Update: they've agreed to pick it up and check it in the next few days, and apparently the verification could take 21 working days! But oh well, at least they agreed to take a look at it.",14,2021-05-11 14:18:18,True,True,post,dubai

10rwzw7,Harassment from Noon.com - reluctance to return/exchange a broken TV.,10rwzw7,Himal22,"Greetings all! So in November I purchased an Evvoli 70inch QLED TV from Noon.com. When I received the item, I noticed that the box had a little bit of damage, some plastic around it was torn, and a plastic strap around it was broken. The driver dropped off the item and then left. After setting the TV up, I plugged it in and the moment I switched it on it showed multiple damage to the LED panels behind the screen, appearing as cracks all across the screen, making it totally unwatchable. I proceeded to call Noon.com and informed them of the matter. At first they seemed very understanding (customer service staff), and were helpful. I was told that the item would be collected and that I would be refunded. I waited, and waited, and waited. Then, I received a call from a supervisor from customer care, saying that the product cannot be returned because I allegedly signed a document accepting the item in good condition. This is false, and they have declined to send me proof of this document. Also, she kept questioning why I didn't ask the driver to help me set up the tv, implying that I damaged the TV while setting it up. I already had a friend who was going to help me. I have been back and forth with them constantly, for the last 2 months, and they always seem to change their story. Then they started asking me for unboxing videos, as proof that the item was already damaged when I opened it. I am not an opportunist who expects the worst. People who do that want to find faults with the products they buy. I have filed a complaint to the DED, and they have informed Noon.com to settle this matter, however the same supervisor calls me and says the same about this alleged document, and that they cannot send me proof of it. She also requests the unboxing video. This has been over 2 months now, back and forth on the same issue. Sitting with a broken TV that I paid 1800aed for, with Noon reluctant to help. I have been accused of: *Accepting/signing a document that the item was in good condition when I received it - THEY CANNOT SEND ME PROOF OF THIS. *Not asking the driver for help when setting up the tv - IT IS NOT THE DRIVERS RESPONSIBILITY TO ASSIST WITH MY INSTALLATION. I CALLED A FRIEND TO COME AND ASSIST ME WITH THIS, AND AFTER PAYING 1800AED FOR THE TV, I WAS DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO BE NEGLIGENT WITH IT. *Not taking an unboxing video when I opened the item - NO WHERE IN NOONS POLICY DOES IT SAY ANYWHERE THAT IF THERE IS ANY DEFECT IN A PRODUCT, THE CONSUMER NEEDS TO PROVIDE AN UNBOXING VIDEO. LIKE I SAID I DONT EXPECT THE WORST WHEN I BUY ITEMS. This is a complete violation of my rights as a consumer, and I really hope that those of you reading this take this as a warning to never buy electronics from Noon, they really dont take their customers seriously. Some of the staff at Noon have absolutely no empathy and are not understanding in this matter at all. Sorry for the rant, I am just so frustrated and helpless!!!!! u/noondotcom Please resolve this issue ASAP, as I am not willing to wait any longer!",73,2023-02-02 22:31:36,True,True,post,abudhabi

uginnp,Shops who can Root Android?,uginnp,benny_a,Does anyone know of shops that can root android phones for you? The backstory is that i bought a note 9 on [Noon.com](https://Noon.com). Obviously its not the latest model but it has a good spec and i got it at a great price. The downside is the phone although it appears new has a dodgy version of android on it. by the way this was not made clear when i bought it and is the downside of buying tech from places like noon (im not sure amazon is any better where the seller is an independent retailer). I would say to anyone thinking of this proceed with caution. Anyway i like the phone and want to keep it. equally for the price i paid i cant be bothered trying to return it. I tried flashing stock android using Odin but it didnt work. I should add i havent bricked the phone it is still working fine. I am not an expert in rooting / flashing using odin but i do like to mess around and customise my tech and followed some youtube videos. Please if anyone knows of a shop or other place where i can take it to get it rooted to a version of android of my choosing do let me know? TIA,5,2022-05-02 09:43:35,True,True,post,abudhabi

wt97h2,Noon.com delivered the damaged dishwasher and doesn't want to take it back.,wt97h2,MarcusDL,"Greetings everyone! I have a sad situation. Maybe someone has some advice for me. About 3 weeks ago, I ordered a dishwasher from u/noondotcom\*\*.\*\*After the delivery (they are not giving connection service) and after the unboxing, I found that the item is damaged and opened complaint.The item was marked as "" This item cannot be exchanged or returned "" but u/noondotcom policies say that if the product has a manufacturing defect, the item can be returned with the original box, information booklet, and all other accessories. After I opened a complaint within a week, nobody contacted me and operators always repeated ""you need to wait for 24-48 hours and the manager will call you"". Only after I started sending messages to u/noondotcom social networks, did they call and promised that they will arrange dishwasher pick up in 24-48 hours. It was 8 days ago. Since then, I had at least two more conversations with u/noondotcom complaint department representatives, and every one of them promised pickup within 24-48 hours. The last time was yesterday with 100% promise that the return has been approved, and the item will be picked up maximum by Sunday evening.Now I received a call from u/noondotcom with an offer to credit 1/3 of the item price to my noon wallet and keep the damaged item. Damage type (strong bump on one of the edges) means that the 24-month warranty for this item is voided. I refused it and received a new promise (guess what) to call within 24-48 hours. Call center representatives refuse to give office addresses to leave personal complaints, and refuse to transfer the call to anyone from managers or supervisors. Order number: NA\*\*\*\*\*\*\*10263 Complaints number: 168686538 - Opened August 1st. 169853406 - Call back request from my husband 10 days ago with no reaction.

r40iem,Horrible service from noon.com,r40iem,SwordMaster78,"Am I the only one experiencing this horrendous service from an online player that wants to compete with Amazon and the likes, nay, actually dethrone Amazon here in the UAE? Pretty much every order I have placed with noon had issues, either delivery was later than promised on the website; not delivered on the day of delivery and the receiving a call that they will bring it the next day (which turned out to be 3 days later), orders for articles that all of a sudden are not available anymore, but when you ordered them they were there on the website and open for ordering. &#x200B; Add to that list - I gave it another go after months ordering at Amazon - where I have yet to encounter an issue. My order now was accepted, after a week of waiting - date given was the 23rd of NOV. Obviously, nothing delivered. I was actually expecting it to be delivered later. Today I just got an sms that said: Order cancelled, refund might take 7 to 14 days to reflect in your account. &#x200B; 0 additional explanation. No email / sms / call to explain why all of a sudden a normally available article all of a sudden gets cancelled.

10kwnuo,"A complete list of LIFE HACK / TIPS / FACTS about Dubai (or UAE) for anyone who is new here, it's still Work in Progress, BUT I will keep updating the list, please contribute I will add more to the list.",10kwnuo,reeegen,"This post was inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/10dd9br/whats_your_dubai_hack/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/10dd9br/whats_your_dubai_hack/) I have listed down some random life hacks or facts that you could use if you are new to Dubai / UAE. ## Useful - 7275: Dubai parking, `<numberplate> <area code> <number of hours>` - example: `T17362 331A 2` - 5566: Sharjah Parking, `<emirate code (DXB, SHJ, AUH, etc)> <number> <number of hours>` - example: `DXB 17362 2` ## Random (but useful) - Setup your **UAE Pass** account and make your life a bit easier - **Pay your traffic fines on December 2nd**, because of the national day there will be some discount (source: friends, news) - Get a **Nol card**, public transport is WAY cheaper than cars. For example, getting to work using a cab is AED 32 for me, and by metro, it's AED 3. - If you are looking for new furniture, a car, or electronics (or planning to sell them), and you are low on cash to get a brand new one, just check the same item on **Dubizzle** and see if it's available there. I have sold a couple of things and bought a few things, there are some weirdos out there in Dubizzle but just be mindful of it. - If you want to see what all is happening in Dubai, [Visit this](https://www.visitdubai.com/en/whats-on/dubai-events-calendar?tags=Leisure+events) - **If you have completely remote work (all 5 days WFH) and you want to save up on money** and you don't care much about living in big cities, **Live in Sharjah**. It's WAY cheaper than Dubai. The basic rule of thumb is the further you get away from Abu Dhabi and Dubai the cheaper the rent is. - **CALL the restaurant and order directly** from them if they have drivers, Zomato (RIP), Talabat, Noon, and Instashop keep as much as 20-30% of the order. The restaurants really appreciate it if you could just call and order from them. AND ALSO it's cheaper than ordering it from the app. - Spinneys and Lulu have a salad bar, I have been buying from there for a good 3-4 months now, and it's amazing, it's cheap, healthy, and filling at the same time. - If you want to drink with friends, do it at home it's exponentially cheaper to buy alcohol and have a small party at home than go to a bar. [This comment that I wrote before](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/10dd9br/comment/j4ozq7v/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - Guide to buying alcohol - If you are in Sharjah: Unisat - If you are in Dubai: MMI or Windmill (Ghantoot) - Other places: The Original Barracuda (UAQ) ## Be careful - One of the worst traffic fines is hitting a pedestrian and jumping a red light. Jumping a red light can give you 12 black points and impounding the car for 30 days (AED 3000 to take it out of the impound) - Be careful of your Salik account balance, you only have 10 days to refill your Salik balance, otherwise, it's AED 150 fine. - Speaking about fines, here are [ALL THE TRAFFIC FINES](https://www.edarabia.com/dubai-police-traffic-fines/) there are 140 different ways to get traffic fines in Dubai <3 - NO PDA ALLOWED - Dubai is a relatively safe city, Just be careful in areas that are away from the main cities... places like Deira, Naif, Karama, International City, and Bur Dubai, have a very bad rep on it being not-so-safe, so please be mindful especially if you are a solo female traveler. - If you are good with money get a Credit Card, My friend uses a Liv Credit card and he made a lot back (around AED 2400 in a year). I use ADCB and their cashback is not that great. So pick and choose a good one. - BE VERY CAREFUL about Instagram shops in Dubai, I got scammed twice and got very shitty products. - If you work in Dubai and live in Sharjah, beware of the 40mins+ traffic you have to go through, you might think it's okay initially, but it will have a huge effect on your mental health and your time in general. - BUY FUEL-EFFICIENT CARS, fuel is really cheap here, and getting a fuel-efficient car will save you a lot of money. - Don't insult any religion (especially Islam), or culture or mock anyone UAE takes very strict actions against that. ## Useful Apps (maybe): - **Dubai Now**: This app lets you basically pay for everything, I pay my DEWA, Home Internet, Mobile bills, Traffic Fines, Nol, and Salik ALL WITH ONE SINGLE TAP. I can't believe many people don't know about this app. - **Dubai Police**: To report crimes, See / Pay for your traffic fines - **Carrefour, Noon Daily, Instashop**: My favorite is Instashop and Carrefour, these apps will allow you to order groceries at home and they reach in 30-40 mins. - **UAE Pass**: After you set it up, your login process for Dubai Now, DEWA and AlHosn, and all that become WAY easier. - **Zofeur**: Are you a bar/pub person, and you always end up drinking a bit too much and have to risk your life to get to your house? Use this app, A dude will come to your car and drop you home. It's kinda expensive, but not as expensive as a cab. - **UrbanCompany**: Home Service App, From part-time cleaners to handymen for plumbing, electrical, etc to PCR tests at home to even A BARBER AT YOUR DOOR to HOME SPA TREATMENT to PEST CONTROL, this has almost every service you need (other apps to check are Rizek and JustLife which provides something similar) - **PropertyFinder & Bayut**: Apps / Websites where you can rent or buy property, Personally I like property finder cause of the UI and the filters. (and they don't mind WebScrapping unlike Dubizzle and Bayut) - **Entertainer**: Excellent discounts & offers on meals or drinks from restaurants. - **Waze**: I stopped using google maps and started using Waze, ONLY cause it shows where the radars are, I learned my lesson by paying almost AED 6000 last year for speeding fines :))) This year I only have 1 ticket, because of Waze. (or you could just drive like a normal human) - **Sarwa**: Robo Investing app, I have been using this for a year now, and it's AMAZING, the customer support is also very amazing, they reply in like 10-20 mins and keep the conversation going. I usually never trust these apps, but since I have been using them for over a year, I love them. - **Tabby and Tamara**: Monthly payment plan, even with a Debit card, I bought every single piece of furniture from IKEA using Tabby and it was amazing, helped me NOT dent my wallet. ## When getting an apartment... - ...make use to get on close to public transport **if you don't have a car**, cause walking to a further away metro station might be okay now (cause its Jan), but in June, July, and August, it's not going to be fun, you will reach your office all drenched in sweat. - ...talk to the people in the building and understand the issues that you might have to face so that it doesn't come as a shock or you can prevent it from happening. - ...take a photo of everything BEFORE you sign the Ejari and pay the security deposit. Because sometimes something might be broken and they won't give your security deposit back (many of my friends faced this issue here) ## Scouring through the internet to find more hacks, tips, and facts: - > 800 numbers are free, and 600 numbers are charged. - credits: [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/u4tz3m/comment/i4yhk5i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - > Petrol pumps change their price at 11:30 pm, so if there is a price change try to be there before 11:30 pm, not 12 am. - credits: [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/u4tz3m/comment/i4yh6fg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - > If you shop regularly from any store (Union Coop, Carrefour, Nesto, Bloomingdales, Enoc,.. any store really), ensure you enroll in their loyalty program. - like (YES App, Shukran, ENOC, ADNOC, and many more) - credits: [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/u4tz3m/comment/i4y5e6w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - > Go to the malls in the early mornings on weekends - credits: [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/u4tz3m/comment/i4xy2i3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - If you hate crowds, do this - > Use the McDonald‚Äôs app for points.

1ch1gvo,I believe (and have plausible proof) that Noon is involved in a massive databreach,1ch1gvo,MRC2RULES,"Okay, where do I start Let me first hook you up with my experience of getting hacked on noon https://www.reddit.com/r/UAE/s/uUCfU8ZEbg I have crosschecked and I am 100% sure that noon is all to blame here. There was no issues or hacking from my side. And the POST itself describes the exact same situation as mine. Getting hacked randomly but not recieving any OTP (you ALWAYS recieve an SMS when trying to log in) Just googling about noon hack will give you many results Now for the past few months, I have been receiving scam sms messages from numbers from countries all around the world. All of them are some fake sms claiming to be from Saudi Post and say you have an undelivered package. Then they ask you to pay ""1.13SAR"" but in reality someone was robbed off of 12,000 RIYALS!! Now what does that have to do with Noon? I posted the screenshots on r/saudiarabia and many users claimed the same thing happening to them! Guess what everyone had in common? All of them had noon accounts. Even my friend was affected by this spam Now there is definite plausibility that noon is responsible for an insecure database since how do you get hacked on noon and soon after start getting spam messages? That too alongside the correlation of people who are getting spam texts with people who have noon accounts Extra Info: I had my noon account compromised. And since I do not use noon regularly, I forgot the password. What do you do? You hit forget password, get an email, and reset the password. What about noon? THERE IS NO FORGET PASSWORD OPTION. You can only reset it provided you remember the old one. Else what? Else you're fucked, support cannot do anything. Your account is in the hands of a malicious individual and you cannot do anything TLDR: Noon is incredibly insecure and is leaking their phone number database. Remove your cards and delete it immediately",39,2024-04-30 23:30:04,True,True,post,UAE
1fogqo1,Amazon and Noon cannibalising it's market place ,1fogqo1,waseembelushi,What started as one of the best businesses for selling online as it turn against the very users who helped it get there in the first place. Here is a video explaining that in dept https://youtu.be/CNIsjGqMMWQ Credit to YT Clynt Both Amazon and Noon have started gating products which do well online and have cut out the sellers who have listed the products in the first place. After selling on Amazon (then souq.com) for more 8 years I can been gated to sell the products which helped me during my hard times. I was a advocate for selling on marketplaces but now seeing many of the companion products go to Amazon it seems like a clap on face for sellers who have contributed towards their growth. I am to blame since I saw the signs but kept going since I had no means to support my family. It's a hard lesson but life goes on. Let me know if you have been gated from selling on Amazon.,10,2024-09-24 20:30:17,True,True,post,UAE

I think it was a TN panel. NOTE \* And i plugged in my wired earphone to the monitor it was important but it doesnt work.(this feature must for me).

Should I go for the Samsung 1000R Curved Immersion experience (easier to see all content infront of you)or 4K HDR Flat Display worth it .....can u really notice 4k/HDR even in games?\*\*Is the Immersion worth it over 4K or vice versa\*\*?

1ej3ysj,I miss the old Namshi,1ej3ysj,Marco_rital,"Anyone here miss the old Namshi ? (Before the Noon acquisition). Among all the UAE companies, Namshi used to be my favorite. They had covered everything a customer needs: - A great customer support with great transparency - Fast delivery times and return policy - A good selection of *authentic* products - A very user-friendly app Since Noon has acquired them, it all went downhill. The customer service has become very bad, the delivery time has increased and there is no longer transparency (some items are shipped without notification or delivered after the due date. Some of them are out of stock and can only be delivered after 2 weeks, while it appeared in stock upon ordering) The app is a disaster, it‚Äôs laggy with a lot of bugs and I hate browsing on it. I have gradually stopped ordering through it but I think the last drop was my last purchase: brand new Adidas shoes that started to ‚Äúpeel‚Äù only 2 weeks after using it.

upga9g,Atlantis Aquaventure Expereince,upga9g,Ni__Mo,"I had been planning to go to Atlantis Aquaventure. Before going to the park, I tried to research on the waterpark online and on this subreddit but there was no information. So, after my visit I decided to write it online for others who might want to experience it. **Planning my visit:** I got a free visit because of the Birthday promotion. Since I could not convince any of my friends to join due to this summer heat, I decided to solo it on a weekday to avoid the rush on the weekends. I would recommend going on a weekday if possible, since even on the weekday it was crowded, so I cannot imagine on a weekend. Mostly visitors consisted Hotel guests who get free access to the waterpark and tourists. The thing I would recommend is to start early to reach the waterpark when it opens, to avoid the rush. **Getting to the waterpark:** I started from union metro station and took the red line until Shobha Realty Metro station. Then I took the tram from Dubai Marina station to Palm Jumeirah Station. From the Palm Jumeirah station, you have to walk to the next building across the street to the Palm Monorail. Please note that your Nol Card does not work at the Palm Monorail. You have to purchase tickets separately at the station and I bought the ticket with the return as it was cheaper. The cost of the ticket was 30 Dhs both ways and you might get discount for some specific bank Debit/Credit cards. The trip along with the wait at the station took me 20 min. I would suggest starting early as the entire trip took me roughly 1:30-2 Hours via public transportation. If you ask Atlantis support, they ask you take a taxi from Dubai Internet City Metro station, which is still quiet far from Atlantis and would be expensive. **At the Ticket center:** Tickets for non-UAE residents is AED 299 normal and 349 for superpass. UAE residents get offer sometimes; Dhs 199 normal and 239 superpass. If you are going on weekdays go for the normal pass. If you are going on a weekend, totally recommend the superpass to avoid long queues. As I had a birthday pass, the only thing I paid was for the lockers. I bought a small locker for 50 dirhams. It is possible to stuff a 20 lit bag and shoes inside the small locker. I would totally recommend buying one because of safety reasons and it is very hot outside. Bigger lockers cost Dhs 80. They also offer you meal deals for 60 dirhams which you can purchase only at the beginning, not possible later and apparently the same food is upwards of 90+ Dirhams inside. They give you separate bands for the admission ticket and lockers and inside you can scan the code on you band to access the lockers. **Stuff I Carried:** Towels, Sunscreen, Swim wear, a swim cap/band if you plan to keep wearing your prescription glasses and most importantly slippers!! The floor gets really hot at noon and your feet start burning. The staff allow your slippers on most of the slides they just ask you to wear it in your hands. So, get slippers with a big strap so you can carry it to the slides. As per the rules, no food is allowed inside and you are allowed only two bottles of 500ml each. But the staff allowed me to take an extra bottle. I totally recommend carrying a bottle of water as it really hot these days and moreover a bottle of water inside is like 10Dhs for a 1dhs 500ml bottle. Some people still snuck some food inside but I don‚Äôt recommend it as they check at the entrance. **Rides:** If you are not going with family, the rides for the adults are the three towers and Surf‚Äôs up wave rider. Splashers Island and Splashers Lagoon are only family areas for kids. I don‚Äôt know how to swim but the only slides which required swimming is the vortex and Immortal Falls. There are plenty of lifeguards at each slide. They are very friendly and you feel safe at all times. Towers/Rides are mentioned in the order I visited. Please note the towers are far away from each other and from the main entrance/lockers. You can always avail the buses to get to different locations in the park for free and would recommend this to avoid the exhaustion from walking to the different towers. **Neptune Tower:** Except the Leap of faith slide, which is a body slide the rest of the slides are tube slides/Water coasters. You can go on all the tube slides alone on a single tube and is more recommended. The good slides in this tower are the leap of faith, Surge and Storm. **Poseidon Tower**: The best tower in my view, with 4 slides. Two body slides, Poseidon‚Äôs revenge and Slitherine, both highly recommended and Aquaconda and Zoomerango also recommended. **Trident Tower**: The newer tower among the other two, this has two body slides, Vortex and Blackout. Two group slides; Odyssey of terror, arguably the best group slide in the waterpark and Shockwave. Medusa lair is two-person tube/coaster ride and Hydra racer is you race to the bottom on a mat. Immortal falls is a point where you get to jump from a height into a deep pool. Please note: This tower has the only two slides, Vortex and immortal falls which fall into a 3m deep pool and requires swimming. Also, at the time of visiting, Hydra racer and Blackpool were closed for maintenance. **Wavehouse**: Apart from the three towers; wave house is you get to surfboard on your belly or on your knees. If you want to surf standing, you have to pay extra 100 dhs for an hour and sign a consent waiver that any injuries during surfboarding is not the responsibility of the waterpark, which I believe is not worth the risk if you are not a pro surfer. Park timings: Park opens at 9:45am and starts at 10:00am and all rides close at 6:30pm. After completing all the slides, I spent the last minutes at 6:30 pm watching the sunset at the private beach at the waterpark and thoroughly enjoyed the sun set at a private beach without the crowd usually at a beach. I have been to all the waterparks in the UAE and this is the arguably the best waterpark I have visited. Here I am comparing to Yas Waterworld, Wild Wadi, Dreamland water park. I have not visited any new waterparks which is have come recently, Ex Laguna Waterpark etc. Why the best; for the number of slides it has to offer, the safety factor for a non-swimmer and ease of travel compared to Yas waterworld. To get to Yas waterworld you need to start real early and you get tired after a day at the waterpark and still have to drive yourself back home. I had visited some time back but upon checking they have not added any new slides recently. The good thing about Yas being the closeness to Ferrari world but you need complete two days to enjoy both Ferrari world and Yas waterworld. Wild Wadi I had visited ages ago but I have heard they have added some new attractions. I hope I have covered the main parts.

Here's where I'm at: I'm only in the UAE for another 8 months because I'll be going to university in NA. I'm looking for a card that I can either get instant signup cashback on or some major travel points to fund my flight later next year. I'm looking at Mashreq's Noon card right now and it looks great - 1k AED instant sign up bonus and no annual fees, I plan on meeting the spending requirements for the first two months through my parents' bank account. I'm going to be researching a lot more though. Here are some questions I've got for now: 1. Some other cards have a 5k income requirement listed; does this mean I can't open with them since I won't have any income the next 4ish years? 2. are there any drawbacks to opening multiple credit cards with no annual fees? I ask because different cards have different perks. 3. Will opening a card in the UAE affect my credit score in the US if I close it before going there (in terms of the average card holding length)? 4. Can I open an American Card and use it here? I've heard you can with just a different phone number but is it illegal. 5. Any other cards I should look into? if YOU, the person reading this at this moment, can answer any of these questions at all, I'd REALLY appreciate it.

wqo1kl,Noon rejected my return request for a Japanese Version Playstation 5,wqo1kl,Beneficial_Buy_1417,"I purchased a Playstation 5 from Noon, and the item delivered was a Japanese Version that has input power of 100V which i cant use here in Dubai as Dubai operates on 220V supply voltage. The item description didnt mention that it is a Japanese version. The writings in the box are in Japenese. I dont mind it initially however after I opened the box, I found a different power plug type compared to what we are using here in UAE and then I read the manual which has English translation and confirmed that it is having a power input of 100V. I even checked from the PS5 device itself that the power input is 100V. I immediately packed the PS5 and all its accessories back to the box and filed for a return. They picked up the item after I filed a return, but I got a message saying it's declined as 'the item is not in original condition.' Now the item is with me and even after multiple complains, they are not resolving my issues. I ordered the item last August 4 and until now they cant find solution to my case. Is it legal that they are selling items that cant be use here in Dubai? Is there any way that I can get a refund to this item or should i just give up?

tsyuqb,Apple iPhone 13 purchase in Dubai,tsyuqb,Akandoji,"I'm planning to buy an iPhone 13 for my mom, but since I'm abroad, I'm not in a position to be present while purchasing. Owing to the number of people commenting here about Noon being shady regarding iPhone purchases, I have decided to order one through Carrefour or Apple directly. From my observations, it seems that there are a number of third party outlets on Carrefour selling their stuff, with Carrefour taking full responsibility for the order. These models also seem to be labeled as ""International"" or ""Japanese"" variants, so I guess FaceTime should be usable on them? Also, would there be any difference in the customer service provided based on the regional differences i.e. will Apple in UAE allow for servicing for those international variants? These models are priced at a relative discount compared to Apple's online store, so I'm assuming there's a catch there somewhere. As someone who doesn't buy or use Apple products as much, I am not so knowledgeable about their service policies, etc, hence the questions.

zvrv5f,Are Refurbished Phones Good in Dubai?,zvrv5f,koomarious,"When we used to think about refurbished phones back in the day, we used to imagine used products that were defective and in need of constant repair. But nowadays the refurbished device business is flourishing. One of the key advantages of getting a refurbished phone is that it may be a more affordable choice than acquiring a completely new gadget. Refurbished phones typically cost less than new phones since they have previously been purchased and used. Consumers on a limited budget or those trying to save money may find this to be especially tempting. Refurbished phones can help customers save money over time in addition to the initial cost reduction. Many refurbished phones come with warranties, enabling the buyer to get any problems fixed or a replacement at no extra cost. This might ease your mind and reduce the cost of repairs or replacements. It's important to keep in mind that the cost savings of a refurbished phone may vary depending on the model, condition, and seller of the device. To obtain the greatest offer, it's crucial to conduct thorough research and compare costs from several sources. Refurbished phones can range in quality, depending on the particular item and the vendor. Refurbished phones should generally be in good working order, although they might not perform or look as nice as new phones. Refurbished phones might have minor physical issues like scratches or dents, but they shouldn't have an impact on how well the phone works in general. In order to be sure the phone is in good working order, the vendor should have properly examined and fixed it. When buying a refurbished phone, it's crucial to conduct thorough research and deal with a dependable vendor. Read customer reviews to get a feel of the seller's reputation and look for merchants that provide warranties or return policies. There are many places where you can find refurbished mobile phone offers, including: Manufacturer's website: Many phone manufacturers offer refurbished versions of their latest models on their own websites. These phones are often factory refurbished and come with a warranty. Online marketplaces: Websites like [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ae/), [Revent.store](https://uae.revent.store/), [Cartlow](https://cartlowstore.app/uae/en), and [Noon.ae](https://www.noon.com/uae-en/) who are the top sellers of preowned devices in Dubai often have a wide selection of refurbished phones available. You can find phones from various brands and at a range of prices. Local electronics stores: Some local electronics stores, may carry refurbished phones in their physical stores. Phone carriers: Some phone carriers offer refurbished phones as part of their plans or as standalone purchases. Manufacturer-authorized refurbishers: Some manufacturers, such as Apple, have authorized refurbishers that specialize in restoring and selling refurbished devices. These refurbishers often offer a warranty and a guarantee that the device has been inspected and tested to meet the manufacturer's standards. When buying a refurbished phone in Dubai, it's important to research the seller and the condition of the device. Make sure the seller is reputable and that the phone comes with a warranty. It's also a good idea to test the phone thoroughly before purchasing to ensure that it is in good working condition.",1,2022-12-26 21:22:09,True,True,post,dubai

q9bnum,[Noon] Electronic product pre-activated / used,q9bnum,thr33_six_n1n3,"Purchased a new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G (Int'l version) from Noon. Third-party seller. The packing was fine with no signs of tampering of any box seal. Was aware that Samsung Pay would not work in the UAE. However, called up Samsung UAE just to see if there's a workaround. During the device verification process, Samsung requested the IMEI number which confirmed that the device was first activated on 7th September 2021. Improbable as I had only received and turned on the device on the date of delivery (10th October 2021). A few more checks back & forth and finally Samsung concluded that the device has definitely been pre-activated by the seller and therefore, the warranty (while active) will be from 7th September 2021. More importantly, it means the device isn't brand new. I've explained the issue to Noon and informed them that I'd like to file for a return/refund. The customer service rep wasn't as understanding and said (*paraphrased*) that the refund eligibility would be decided once their relevant department has checked what they need to check but all devices are pre-activated by the seller when they receive it which is normal. I find that hard to believe. However, their return policy for electronics states: "" 1. *The product must be returned with the original packaging, sealed, and unopened.* 2. *If the product has been used, or the product‚Äôs original box was opened, or the original seal was removed, we will decline the refund and return the product back to you unless there is a manufacturing defect.* 3. *If the product is not working due to a manufacturing defect, the original box, information booklet, and all other accessories must be returned too.* "" I am unsure of what my options are but being sold a pre-activated device under the guise and price of a brand new product isn't all that pleasing. I do not intend on using the device any further and would be filing for a return/refund with Noon after re-packing it in its original box. **Question:** What are my options if Noon decides to decline the return/refund request basis their policy? Samsung has urged me to inform Noon that they can call up Samsung to confirm the above whenever they wish to do so. TL;DR: Ordered a brand new phone online, manufacturer says it had been pre-activated more than a month before I placed the order.

vp0p2m,Transfer of Amazon UAE Store & Trade License,vp0p2m,samm1919,"Hello! Is anyone interested in taking over my Amazon store? It's based on a Freezone license that includes a RAK Bank business account. It was an ordeal getting the bank account and now that I'm leaving the country, feels like a shame letting it go to waste. If anyone is interested, please DM me. This is what you will get: 1. Sharjah media city (Shams) **Freezone company license** 100% ownership. I am the sole owner. Trade license is paid for till March 2023. Company incorporated by me back in 2018. 2. Ability to add visas and sponsor self, family and employees for UAE residence. No limits, just add in the quota. 3. Company is **VAT registered** and VAT returns are filed every three months without fail. No outstanding penalties are on the account. 4. **Business account** with RAK Bank includes an unused cheque book. 5. **5-star rated store on Amazon AE**. We started out on Souq in 2017 and were moved over onto the Amazon platform after the takeover. We had a modest turnover of around 500-600k AED when we started out. Over the years, changing priorities led to loss of focus and eventually sales in the business. 6. Also have a seller account on **Noon** and an in-progress application with Carrefour online. And, if you're new to this or if you need help, here's more: 1. I'll teach you the bare basics of selling on Amazon using FBA. 2. You'll also see what I have sold over the past few years and you could continue or try something new. 3. I'll help you with the process of labeling items and getting the FBA shipments ready for either pickup or if you're more adventurous, you could don the Amazon warehouse jacket and head over to one of their fulfilment centers yourself, to offload your first shipment. 4. A **thermal label printer** and company stamps to get you started. 5. An **Impulse heat sealing machine** (to pack those nuts and stuff) 6. A **shrink wrap blower** (to shrink wrap those tidy little packets or fix damaged packaging due to shipping issues) 7. The current Amazon store has some inventory that will be yours upon takeover. 8. Plenty of Amazon shipping packets if you decide to sell from home immediately or ship yourself. Please DM me. I'll help as much as I can. Only if you're serious, please. We all know friends who are interested in starting a business because they've been having a tough time at work and all that fades away after an increment or a new job. This requires commitment and patience. And here's a ready setup to take over. Reasonable offers will be appreciated. Thanks!",6,2022-07-01 17:19:48,True,True,post,abudhabi

E: to add in, I tried calling the delivery drivers number listed on the app about 5 times within the next hour of receiving the message and it was ignored. How do I know it was ignored? On one of the calls it said line is busy. I called a minute after that and it kept ringing with no answer.

uig5hy,Noon Food Delivery: Worst online food delivery ever,uig5hy,Lululu2001,"We usually experience late delivery from Noon Food. This is a common issue, however, we experienced unforgettable which is our main reason not to use this freaking app anymore. We ordered burger meal from McDo this evening. I craved so much for french fries and ice cream cause of my PMS. We opened the door and the delivery guy handed over our food to us. Then, he asked for a water. We were skeptic at first cause it is not common for a delivery guy to ask for a water. We thought that it is too hot outside and of course, we gave a water to him üòÉ. We checked the food bag and it was sealed. The delivery guy left after we gave him the water. After few minutes, we opened the bag by cutting the seal. We did not peel off the seal. I was so excited as I craved so much for my order. Guess what? There are only few fries left in the package! Someone ate my food! We were shocked cause it is our first time to experience it. Eventually, we noticed that one of the seal is not sticky anymore! We suspected that the delivery guy ate the food cause (1) he asked for a water; and (2) I don't think that McDo will do it - they have standard protocols to follow. Because the seal is not sticky enough, we thought that the delivery guy just put back the seal. We couldn't call directly the store or the delivery guy cause there are no contact details showing in the app. The only available is a chat with the customer representative. We sent the pictures as a proof. The representative acknowledged it that there is a mistake from their side. I am so disappointed cause I anticipated so much for my order üò≠. We asked if they can reorder the food (even the fries only) but they informed us to wait for another person to call us. The other Noon guy called us and said that half of the price will be refunded to us. I am so disappointed to their service. They refunded only 1/3 of the price. The thing is, we couldn't eat the remaining food anymore because someone already opened the bag before we received it. We couldn't say that remaining food is safe to eat. We ordered another meal from Mcdo, but this time, via another delivery app instead (Deliveroo). I know that the food we ordered from Noon is cheap but I couldn't comprehend why someone would do that to us. As a food delivery company, they should take this seriously and at least, they should've reordered the whole meal for us for free. Now, we promised not to use this app anymore. I do not usually post here but it is good to share this here. I hope this scenario will not happen to you.

zwbpng,Noon 15 minute delivery.,zwbpng,Distinct-Drama7372,I tried out the 15 minute noon delivery for the first time and I was pleased with the service unlike their e-commerce or food delivery. The dark store was few signals away from my place and there was an assurance that delivery fees would be refunded if not delivered within the time mentioned in the app. Their definition of delivery is the rider has reached the location. The rider confirmed my location upon arrival and marked the delivery as successful before getting the product(but that's okay I guess). I found the price of their products bit reasonable as well(compared to talabat outrageous prices). But what concerns me is are the riders risking their lives for such deliveries? Are there sufficient dark stores located to cover the 15 minutes delivery? Has anyone been refunded the delivery fees for late delivery? Can this system still beat the local baqala system which offers credit and quick delivery?,9,2022-12-27 13:29:37,True,True,post,dubai
ug3bxj,Noon food delivery (if they actually manage to deliver your food) is bad,ug3bxj,eyadshak,"I ordered my food at 6 PM, just like I do everyday during Ramadan. Being a lazy person that lives alone, I rely heavily on food delivery, and almost all my food is delivered. At 7 PM, I checked my noon app so see where my food it, it says the order was delayed to 8 PM, its alright I guess, sometimes food gets delayed no need to get mad, I can manage to not eat for an extra hour. At 7:45 PM, I check again, the food was pushed back again to 8:25. This has happened before, so its not new, I guess I am unlucky. &#x200B; At 8PM I check the app again, my order is now cancelled, I did not get a notification, I did not get an SMS, it just said that I canceled my own order. I ask for support from noon since I did no such thing, support says someone will contact me. I get a call after 10 minutes saying sorry your order was canceled because of the high demand and there were no drivers available, I said that its 8PM already everyone has their food, how is there a high demand, they say they are sorry. I asked why was my order canceled after 2 hours, why not cancel it when I placed it, or maybe an hour after, and why didn't I get a notification. The support representative agreed, its not his fault after all, he wasn't the one who programmed the app or the one assigned to deliver my food. He apologized again (not his fault though) and said as way to apologize to me they will refund my order amount ( geez thanks a lot for refunding my own money). &#x200B; This is the 2nd time my food was delayed by more than two hours, and second time my order was canceled after the delay. I ordered food around 20 times this Ramadan, so that's a 10% fail rate. Am I that unlucky or is their service this bad. &#x200B; Hungry venting over.",9,2022-05-01 20:18:23,True,True,post,dubai

uqamcy,Moved to the London from Dubai. Observations after 6 months,uqamcy,pastaKarhai,"I lived in Dubai for 3 years before moving to London. We all agree Dubai has its flaws but let's not ignore the good side of it while acknowledging its flaws too. 1. Law and order: It's hard to disagree here, but I took it for granted and I think Dubai is very under-appreciated in this regard. 2. Beaches: I miss JBR and marina beach, beaches are hard to find in London and considering it colder too 3. Infrastructure: You know how everything governmental can be accessed through an app, airports and metro stations have maintained bathrooms. You can fill out your nol card via any bank app, metro trains are new and clean. I used to take all those things for granted. 4. Delivery Services: I have had a much better exp with noon/amazon in Dubai than amazon/asda/tesco etc in London 5. Renting a place: It's much much harder in London compared to Dubai 6. Taxes :D &#x200B; However, appreciating Dubai doesn't mean I am taking anything away from London.

As soon as this happened another delivery rider tried to slow down carefully but his bike also slipped and he fell. I stopped the car and asked them to just park until it stops raining (I know they can't but i tried). The guy just shrugged and carried on. I took the u-turn towards MBZ and there was a car jam. Turns out another noon delivery guy slipped. Its that damn bricked road. My request to folks from motor City is to not order during a rainy day.

There are feedback about unavailable food delivery services, long travel distances, problems with security having to get NOC for each service provider, problems with maintenance... I'm planning to move there given the extreme rental increases across, DH2 is still justifiable comparing to what you get. My main questions as of today, and if anyone can please help 1- Does it still feel like the outskirts (keeping distance out of this) in terms of food delivery services and such? I have been checking and can see many of the restaurants I love and usually order do deliver through Careem from Motor City and there is also Noon 15 mins grocery and Instashop. 2- Is it truly a nightmare if you need to get a service provider? for example if I do need some maintenance works done? or if I need to get a pet groomer 3- In terms of distance, yes I do understand the location and how far it is, but I have been comparing it with current travels and I don't require to go to work every day, so I think that should be ok. But in terms of traffic during off peak times from Downtown to DH2 any thoughts? And if anything else comes to mind please let do share.

Serial number on the box is different from that inside the case and also while it says assembled in USA on the case it says assembled in China on the Box (See image 1 & 2) 3. The MagSafe charging does not work. The transparency mode does not work and the noise cancellation does not work. The adaptive mode which is a feature in AirPods Pro (Gen 2) does not show up at all.

D2C E-Commerce in Mainland (Ownership of Goods is with your (FZ) company):** **FZ companies can't import directly into mainland (correct?)** **Also FZ companies can't deliver directly to individual consumers in mainland (correct?)** **Solution:** Hire a clearing agent to import your goods from FZ/Overseas to mainland and transfer ownership of goods to your company finally. Store goods in subleased WH and fulfil last mile delivery through a courier agent. **(correct?)** **2) Buying from a local company in mainland and selling to another local company in mainland:** **Solution:** Simply follow Order/Invoice/Payment process with both companies, delivery of goods need to happen thorough logistic partner, can‚Äôt be delivered by FZ company. **(correct?)** \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* **Original Post:** Hi, There is so much ambiguity online & confusing advice about Freezone Companies operation with businesses in mainland. Title explains, seeking for advice/info from actual business owners of FZ companies, who are already doing business with mainland companies on how it works. (I intend to have a General Trading License in Meydan FZ and work with Mainland/External companies B2B only & plan to sell some stuff online via AMZ/Noon. In mainland or FZ, I don't plan to lease a physical office and/or rent a Warehouse with Ejari in my company name or plan to open a Physical Store or work with Govt depts., hence not opting for Mainland General Trading License due to high cost). I know there are 1000's of FZ companies doing business with mainland companies and how they do is as below, What I have gathered till now by from various people/companies/internet. Please validate as true or post correction where applicable: **1. D2C E-Commerce in Mainland (Ownership of Goods is with your (FZ) company):** **FZ companies can't deliver directly to individual consumers in mainland (correct?)** So, you can sublease a fulfillment Centre or Warehouse in mainland **(can we?)**, can have your own website selling your stuff **(can we?)** and/or can list in Amazon/Noon etc.,. The order from your website/AMZ/Noon goes to WH/Fulfillment Centre, they or your hired courier company deliver last mile to individual customers in mainland, your inward inventory & sold is tallied and you get your sales amount directly in your business bank account from your website/AMZ/Noon. (in any case FZ company/person simply can't take a Van/Car and deliver the goods by themselves to customer in mainland) **Also FZ companies can't import directly into mainland (correct?)** Then to get your goods to that WH/Fulfillment Centre, you need to:: **a) Your Own Imported Goods** \- Issue order to your supplier in China etc., pay them directly from your Business Bank Account. then either **a1)** Pick the goods via shipping company from their port/WH and bring into any FZ (with port like JAFZA) with your own Import Code. (Because you can't import into mainland with your Import Code) so hire a clearing agent, transfer ownership of goods to them, they inward the goods into mainland in their Import Code by paying custom duty & VAT etc.,, then transfer ownership of goods back to you & deliver the goods to your chosen WH/Fulfillment Centre. or **a2)** Let that shipping company pick the goods from origin itself as a shipper & consignee as well, bring the goods directly to mainland (by paying custom duty/VAT) to your chosen WH/FC and transfer the ownership of goods to your FZ company name (avoiding multiple charges/effort of transfer of ownership as in a1). It's said that many companies get fines at time of audit/inspection, because they sometime get the goods released from JAFZA/RAKEZ Port etc., (JAFZA/RAKEZ releases goods without you paying custom duty/VAT assuming the goods are going to another FZ, that is, where your company is hosted say Meydan FZ). If these goods are taken goods to WH/FC in mainland instead of your host FZ area and start selling, then it's liable to fines and bans. **b) Goods are Already in any of FZ area imported till FZ by some other company:** Need a similar arrangement as in a1, either that FZ company (or your FZ company if ownership transferred to you) need to hire clearing agent to bring goods into mainland by paying custom duty/VAT and deliver to your chosen WH/FC and transfer the ownership to your FZ company. **c) Goods are Already in Mainland** : **c1) Buying from Local Mainland Company Directly (can we?)** Simply issue order to local company and pay via your business bank/cheque and let them deliver to your chosen WH/FC. **(right?)** (does the ownership of goods transfer happen to you simply by executing this transaction of issuing PO/getting Invoice/delivery note or any other step involved?) **c2) Buying from Local FZ Company Directly (can we? goods are already in mainland)** Simply issue order to local company and pay via your business bank/cheque and let them deliver to your chosen WH/FC. **(right?)** (does the ownership of goods transfer happen to you simply by executing this transaction of issuing PO/getting Invoice/delivery note or any other step involved?) in both above cases (c1 & c2), how do you make sure that the goods you are buying from are custom duty & Import VAT already paid? **2) Buying from a local company in mainland and selling to another local company in mainland:** Simply issue order to 1st company and pay via your business bank/cheque and let them deliver (or arrange delivery company) to 2nd company after obtaining PO from & submitting Invoice to 2nd company **(right?)** (does the ownership of goods transfer happen to you from 1st company and then from you to 2nd company simply by executing these transactions of issuing PO/getting Invoice/delivery note or any other step involved?) How do you make sure that the goods you are buying from 1st company are custom duty & Import VAT already paid?

Apple parts (cheap plastic, Apple logo on it but not Apple which makes it a counterfeit spare part) c) Japanese specs which was not advertised as it has different options with shutter sound especially when traveling to Japan. I made a return request within the hour after delivery and now Noon says they won't accept a return as it is against their policy. For over a week they keep me waiting even tried several times to deliver that fake phone again. Any suggestions on this? Shall I open a chargeback with American Express. It is not ok to sell a phone with those issues and a policy does not apply here. Just the fake parts alone are unlawful. Many thanks. Everyone be very careful with buying on Noon - it is not to be compared with Amazon or any other shop.

While they were waiting, there was a drum of water that each one was taking from to quench their thirst. Not a water dispenser, just a blue drum. Not cold water, just a drum out in the open. It was a sad sight to see how hard these guys work, no matter all the rants of the way they drive, etc. Later in the day, I ordered some food, and saw these stats on Noon App. The rider to deliver my food had driven 263 kms delivering 32 orders, but just received 2 tips. That, imho, is another sorry state. The same app charges a service fee that we pay, but not the tip to a driver who rides in the heat? Is this an isolated case of a rider, or is tipping delivery riders just not a thing. Having been Dubai for long, tipping is definitely a norm though.

So anyways i helped the chap up scolded him like his dad abt how he couldve gotten hurt n stuff. Then i told him that I didn't mind paying for his fine etc as long as his company could cover the insurance for my cars damage (i have 3rd party insurance) 7amdulillah nobody got hurt, we filed a police report, i did it and mentioned exactly what happened. etc. Now i just received a call from the station stating that the driver flipped the story and basically said that I was the one who hit him instead and we were supposed to meet at the police station and sort it out. After he hung up, the biker called me himself stating that he is poor and couldnt pay off his last fine and that if he gets another one his license will get cancelled (not true). He agreed it was his fault etc. on call. Now the question is, if (IF) i have this call recorded and present it to the police, would I get into trouble for invasion of privacy? p.s. idrm paying off stuff im j pissed off the guy lied even after i told him id cover the costs of everything. (insurance also wouldve been cheaper for me to pay off than to pay for an entire new front bumper, wiring & paint.

vobsdf,Noon and their ‚Äúoutstanding customer service‚Äù,vobsdf,Uneducated_Exbert,"Hi there, I just saw a post regarding noon‚Äôs horrible return policy and if people think it‚Äôs a one-off here is my story. I ordered a Samsung phone on April 20 and two days later it was delivered, to my surprise I opened the package and there was no phone at all, it was full of hair products. My first thought was this must have been a wrong order delivered to me. I go to the application and check my order status and voila, it says delivered. Me thinking this must have been a logistic error I called the customer service immediately and explain to them that the item I received is a completely different from the item I ordered, to which they informed me somebody will call me in the next 24 hours. Not long after that somebody calls me and informs me to just return the item and they will refund the full amount within one week. I asked them if there is any possibility that they can just send the phone instead to which they replied with ‚Äòyou can just order the phone again‚Äô. Since nothing out of the ordinary has happened till this point, I order the phone again two days later on April 26 the phone gets delivered and the return item was collected at the same time. Everything that happened since the collection of the return has been a shit show to say the least. I get a call from customer service the next day and asks me if this is a good time to talk, I‚Äôm like Yes. He informs me that they are working on my return to which I ask what‚Äôs the update and his response was we‚Äôre working on it and goes to ask me if there is anything else that he can help me with. I felt like I was being pranked or something like what was the whole point of calling me at that moment. Shortly after that I went on a holiday back home for 3 weeks so I couldn‚Äôt follow up with the return but I kept on sending them email for an update on my return. And every time they send me the most robotic response ‚Äúsorry for the inconvenience we‚Äôre experiencing delay in processing the return. However, please note that we have forwarded your concern with email in this regard to the relevant team handling your issue.‚Äù Three weeks go by with no update and finally after returning to Dubai on May 20 I call customer service and request for an update her exact response was‚Äù money coming back to yanni yanni wallet two more days coming to your bank‚Äù even though I was furious I just responded with thank you and hang up the phone. What really baffles me is how can you put somebody with limited spoken English in the English customer service department. The only reason people are calling customer service center is when customers are furious and how do you expect somebody with that type of vocabulary to deal with people who are furious when they can‚Äôt even convey what want to say properly. A week goes by since my last phone call nothing happens, I call again and this time I talk to helpful agent and informs me that she will escalate the complaint and I will get a callback within 24-48 hours. I get that awaited phone call to which they assure me they will solve the matter within 24 hours again to my surprise nothing happens. I again call on June 1 they repeat the process of escalating and again they give me same response that I‚Äôll get a call back in 48 hours. Somebody calls me and informs that they need more time to investigate since some customers are abusing the system by returning wrong item. I was like okay! So now you‚Äôre going the route of accusing me even though I reported the issue 10min after delivery and asked how long will that take? As usual they said we‚Äôll call you back which they never did. Since then, I have called several times and every time it‚Äôs different excuse which always ends with the we‚Äôll call you back and update you with the result. I even asked one of the agents who called me to give a number where I can follow up with; she told me please reach us through social media, like wow really?!!! So here I am reaching out on social media and appreciating Noon for perfecting the art of sweeping the shit under the rug.

First I thought it was a setting issue and maybe it's a reflection since I was sitting at a particular angle but then I was shocked that wasn't the case. I immediately tried to call the delivery guy but no response. Then reached out to noon customer care via their helpline. They asked details and initially asked to send out an email with picture proof of the TV. The email was sent. The lady also mentioned that a complaint was raised and it would be resolved within 6 working days. After 2 days a response came on the email mentioning a link with service centers which would repair the TV...it said to claim warranty . I still went through the link and tried to reach out to all the numbers and suppliers available since I was desperate. None answered. I also requested a call back from their supervisor to which I was always told that it would be done. I have spoken to around 5 customer service agents in the past 11 days and also to a lady from their escalations department and all these people did was tell me that the case is open and under consideration. Consideration for what? No one was able to answer this question. The Finally the escalations lady said that it had been escalated to the top people for approval for a refund. All I want is the TV to be replaced. I don't want a refund. The customer service teams talks out of a script and after 2 calls you can literally predict what the next sentence is going to be.

They said the chats and calls and pics I sent of proves aren't counted unless I sent them on email . Eventho the people I spoke with earlier told me they made the complaint and attached the videos and pictures to it ... This is the 1st time something like this happens.

17ywmz6,Are restaurant reviews accurate?,17ywmz6,mambo-nr4,Seems there's a huge gap in how people review restaurants on delivery apps compared to Google. For e.g I saw a restaurant with a 4.2 rating on Careem or Noon but 2.9 on Google. My last delivery was a god-awful cloud kitchen that made me a 1-star meal yet were rated almost 4/5 on the app. This got me thinking: presumably the app's customers are the restaurants they sign on and take a cut from when people pay. Why would they allow that 'customer' to drop to low ratings and this lose business? That would surely make some restaurants delist themselves from the app,13,2023-11-19 16:56:59,True,True,post,dubai

177tca2,"Delivery drivers - Frustration, Race or intentionally trying to get hurt?",177tca2,darvin218,"Hey folks, I had this bizzare encounter in the Business Bay DIFC underpass this noon: I was driving in the second lane when a delivery biker zoomed in the first lane at high speed. I waited for him to pass so I could switch lanes, but he suddenly popped up in my blind spot and started tailing me. I decided to speed up a bit to make my lane change, but the biker matched my speed and continued riding in my blind spot. This went on as I repeatedly attempted to give him room to move ahead, but he kept slowing down, seemingly determined to stay right there. I eventually pushed my accelerator and cruised along. But what is this behavior? Just to clarify, I drive a muscle car which has reasonable respect on the road, so it should not be about road ego. So, I'm wondering: Was he staking a claim on the first lane as his territory, even though it's not recommended for bikes (as per RTA)? Or maybe he wanted to race, though that doesn't make much sense. Or was he intentionally trying to provoke an accident for some post-accident ulterior motive? What do you all think? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",7,2023-10-14 20:30:16,True,True,post,dubai

They sold me a Galaxy s21 and promised it to be delivered by the last Thursday. I waited for a week and realized that the promised delivery time jumped two days to the future. Gave them a call and they told me that the actual delivery will be on Friday. After that the delivery day changed each day. Now they promise it by tomorrow. After calling to the call center I left speechless. The operator literally said that they don't have a clue when or if my order will be delivered to me. So their advice is to cancel the order and place another one or wait. How much time should I wait they don't say because they don't know. What the operator also said is that I placed an order when the item was out of stock, inclining that it was my fault. But I do remember that there were no messages saying that the item is out os stock or something like that.

qzl1le,The worst experience with NOON,qzl1le,Ahsan1113,"I had been waiting for the Nothing Ear 1 since months and It finally came on noon so I just pre ordered in on 8th of November. The expected delivery was supposed to be 20th November. Unexpectedly I did not receive my package on 20th. So I contacted their live customer support chat. They just replied me with the line "" The issue has been forwarded to relevant department, please wait for 48 hours"". I was like sure, I waited like 12 days for the package 2 more days wont make any more difference. Today on 22nd November I call them in the morning and the lady replies me ""sir still 5 hours are left since you made the complain, you are supposed to wait for 48 hours"". I was literally running out of patience but I just waited and I contacted them after 5 hours. &#x200B; I contacted the live chat again and they just straight forward told me ""The item is out of stock, you can order the item again from express"". First of all I waited 14 days for them to just tell me that the item is out of stock. I pre ordered it. If someone preorders something the item is literally reserved for them. A stock is kept for them. Why were they accepting pre orders when they did not have stocks??? After they cancelled my ordered I requested them to give me noon credit so I can buy the same item from express. Refund to hit my bank account must have taken 7-14 days so it was better to get noon credit instantly and just get the item again. But noon had to make it worse for me. They hit me with "" Due to technical issues the noon credit is not being reflected to your account, the problem has been reported to the relevant department, issue might take 48 hours to be resolved"". So now I lost my money and I didnt get the item too. Great customer satisfaction by noon. I literally feel like I got scammed.

ykqi0u,Terrible experience with Noon,ykqi0u,DannyZilo,"I purchased a pair of Sony WMH-1000MX4 headphones from Noon at the ""bargain"" price of AED 950. Excellent delivery experience, until I actually collected my item from building security and found that the package was considerably lighter than I was expecting, (having been an owner of the previous version of these headphones, the MX3, for over 5yrs; I know there's a little more weight to these fantastic headphones). Sure enough, I opened the package suspiciously and inside I found a pair of Sony MDR ZX110AP headphones. Current price on Noon for this pair is AED 45. Called Noon customer support and was told that I have to wait 3 days for someone to call me back, who will arrange a return, then I will be refunded and ""able to order the item again"". My issue with this is it is clearly going to take a while for me to get the refund, which essentially means that I've paid out AED 950 for it to just leave my account for a couple of weeks (if I'm lucky), before I am able to purchase the headphones elsewhere. You guessed it, I won't be trying to purchase them again from Noon! Also massively disappointed as I'm moving into a new apartment in December and planned on purchasing a lot of the essentials from Noon; TV, Microwave, Fridge/Freezer, Air Fryer, etc. As when I priced these up in other stores compared to Noon the saving was over AED 2500.

Bought it, and when the courier delivered my scooter, I gave him 1712 AED + 38 AED tip (that is what I thought) Turned out I had 1000 AED bills instead of 100 AED bills and I gave him 17050 instead of 1750 AED, so 15300 more. I didnt notice that because I was so exhausted. Next day I was looking for the money and I was nearly sure I must have lost it, maybe it felt out of my pocket etc. I gave up after 2 hours of searching the apartment. We had 7 big suitcases when we were moving to Dubai and we stayed in a hotel for 2 weeks so it was a mess and I was sure I just lost the money somehow. Next day the courier messaged me on Whatsapp and he told me that I gave him 17k. It is unbelievable for me. I am from Poland, there is no way anybody would write me admitting he got so much money. I wasnt even thinking I gave him that amount, so he informed me all by himself.

Who'd refuse such deal. That day, I decided I will delay ordering it till evening only to find out that the app was broken, it had technical difficulties and was crashing.I got soooo pissed then the next day, I open the app and it's working fine but I had a gut feeling to delay ordering it to see what this technical issues are all about. I checked their instagram to find that many people were complaining of the same issue. I submitted a request to their support team on two different emails but with no luck. Till today the issues are still there; it would work for few hours then it would be crashing most of the time. What's strange is that, regardless of this issues on their app AND website, they are still advertising through social media account. I also still see their ads everywhere and with crazy discount prices. Like this one for Nike shoes, it was 56% off and sometimes I see shoes ads for 1% which is also weird. So I'm genuinely asking does anybody knows what's wrong with Namshi app? Is it still working? Has anyone faced a similar experience and tried to order but they have recieved their order anyways?

fcrtaw,The case for local mobile wallet apps in UAE ( or GCC),fcrtaw,startuphameed,"The central theme of some of the most valuable tech businesses worldwide is a payment wallet that they've built. Whether it is PayTM, Alipay, Wechat pay, Gojek Pay, PayPay etc are billion $ products that are widely used by people in respective countries. Most peer-to-peer transactions are through these apps these days. Google entered this game through google pay and now amazon is active with amazon pay. To give perspective, people give alms to beggars in china through these apps. I noticed people paying small amounts in tea shops in India using PayTM Now we see careem and noon getting a bit aggressive on this game here in the region. (Careem is also trying to be a super app). UAE is late to the party at least by 7-8 years. Do you foresee more merchants accepting careem and noon for micropayments? Who is going to be the winner ?... noon or careem? PS : Banks are quite unsuccessful in this game globally.",4,2020-03-03 12:46:44,True,True,post,dubai
h7fwt7,Staying safe from the pandemic and its challenges,h7fwt7,kaikemy,"The phased opening from this pandemic has begun but the economic recovery will take time. Reading about financial struggles, browsing this sub and watching charity ads online motivated this post. The information here is consolidated from my own experiences, general advice and from other subs to form a guide. Treat this guide as a basic template for hard times: * **Money**: Keep track of changing fee schedules such as minimum balance requirements and credit cards. Banks are squeezed for liquid cash and will transfer their burden where they can. Here's an example: ADCB Excellency started [charging a fee](https://www.adcb.com/en/Images/1-fees-dl-english-brand-v18-030520_tcm41-231844.pdf) for their TouchPoints Infinite Card of AED525/year in October 2019. It was [free](https://www.adcb.com/Images/SOF-DL-eng-brand-V13_tcm9-153873.pdf) before then. * If you have money lying around in current accounts, stash it into an FD or a high interest bearing account. This [article](https://www.thenational.ae/business/money/the-9-best-high-interest-savings-accounts-for-2019-1.815890) lists ones that might interest you. Be wary though, chasing returns is not always the best. There can be hidden expenses or charges or the customer service is terrible. * My idle money was losing value to inflation (non-interest bearing). Rejigged the whole setup so I can generate some surplus after covering minimal costs like Netflix. * Avoid debt like the plague. Loans, EMIs, CC balances and overdrafts are unnecessary in good times and dangerous in bad times. * **Expenses**: Spend less on peripheral services. Over the last few months, you were probably left with more spare money than usual. Frugality was the way of life. Trips to the barber/salon, nightlife and fine dining came to a grinding halt and it led to savings. Learn from this revelation. * **Mindful Shopping**: Avoid impulse buying. Online shopping has made it too easy to shop till your fingers drop. A good rule of thumb is to forget it exists. My golden rule is any frivolous purchase must be made in store. We can catch ourselves scrolling through pages for fun until we cave in and buy unnecessarily. Out of sight, out of mind. * **Jobs**: Some are struggling to make ends meet as companies have closed temporarily or laid off their workforce to reduce expenses. Treat looking for work like a job. Your approach must be holistic: * Put your name on every hiring agency and job sites: Bayt, Gulf Talent, Indeed, LinkedIn etc. This sub hosts monthly Job [Seekers](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/gub15u/monthly_rdubai_job_seekers_thread_june_01_2020/) and [Offers](https://www.reddit.com/r/dubai/comments/gub17n/monthly_rdubai_job_offers_thread_june_01_2020/) posts as well. It's relatively quiet but worth a shot. * Employers, entrepreneurs, influential people, networkers and the empathetic looking for candidates or help outside the usual areas can use the Reddit posts mentioned above. * Online training courses to learn new skills, improve existing ones and increase your appeal. Coursera and Udex offer free online courses from reputable institutes and seasoned lecturers. IT professionals are in high demand and the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) is highly recommended for those looking to switch careers. * Job and career fairs are an organic way of reaching out. [CUAE](https://10times.com/careers-uae) hosts fairs and are worth looking into. * Volunteering is great. You learn new skills, contribute to society and grow your network. My previous employer hired someone he met volunteering, it does happen. It can also be used to bolster resumes as well. * **Accommodations**: If accommodations are becoming an issue, speak to your landlord or rental agency. Ask for a reduction or delay in payment. Eviction disputes are taken to [RERA](https://www.propertyfinder.ae/blog/evrything-you-know-about-rera-rental-property-laws/). * **Food**: We all enjoy pampering ourselves to a nice evening out. Enjoying some foreign cuisine at a classy restaurant and posting it all over social media but this comes at a hefty price. It's fine in moderation but can quickly turn into a money trap. Cooking at home is cheaper, healthier and eventually easier. * Large grocery stores offer great deals: Carrefour, Lulu, Al Maya, Fathima, West Zone, the list goes on. * If you wish to enjoy some great hot food and high quality ingredients: Spinneys, Kibsons and organic stores will have what you need. * Online retailers such as Amazon and noon also offer some consumer staples for cheaper than stores ([u/ASJ-1991](https://www.reddit.com/user/ASJ-1991/)). * **Travel**: Opt for public transport. Bus, metro, tram will save you big in the long run. All details on cards, features and fee structures can be found [here](https://www.nol.ae/RtaPortal/ShowDoc/StaticContentRepository1/pdf/en/NOL_Brochure). * Owning a car is convenient but insurance, petrol and maintenance add up quick. Dubizzle is a popular marketplace for used cars. Emirates Auction is another but I'm skeptical at best by the prices and the auction method. * **Thrifting**: Buy used where possible. Dubizzle, Melltoo and countless FB groups will provide the platform you need to buy cheap or sell to make some income. If you're struggling to make ends meet, there is [Dubai Charity Center](https://goo.gl/maps/ByxTjqbyX5AspKZt5). * Cheap electronics can be found on Amazon AE and hotspots like Al Ain Center and computer street. * If you're looking for apparel on the cheap: Dubai Outlet Mall, SSS Outlet on Bank Street and Oasis Center have shops that sell for less than premium prices. **TL;DR: This is a basic guide to frugality. Most are aware of the information here but consolidating it helps.** Hope this helps and feel free to contribute in the comments. It's a good opportunity for me to learn as well.",46,2020-06-12 11:05:23,True,True,post,dubai

w1vyfd,Couple of thoughts on this sub,w1vyfd,TheNameIsPointless,"Hey everyone, firstly I‚Äôd like to say that I really enjoy this sub because the community is incredibly kind and helpful. As you‚Äôre all aware, there‚Äôs a fair amount of negative posting on this sub though, with everyone‚Äôs individual experiences with different products and services. I think that‚Äôs fine to a large extent because it lets people know what to steer clear of and prevents others from having those similar bad experiences. However, if that‚Äôs the case, then should we also be allowed to talk about things that have helped us? I say this because I had a post taken down where I talked about how texting a therapist on Mimblu has helped me tremendously with my mental health. And my goal was to share that with folks because I know how times are and this is a super important topic. I‚Äôd also like to talk about how good my experiences with Careem and their customer service have been. Also how terrible my experiences with Noon have been (like a large part of the population on this sub). I feel as a community, we should be able to not only share our negative experiences but also our positive ones. Would love to hear what you think.

17e7adn,weekend in october 2023 deatiled aquaventure waterpark birthday pass,17e7adn,Purple-Ad6907,"**Introduction:** thanks to Reddit posts from more than two years ago and the valuable contributions from others, I was able to maximize the value of my birthday pass at the Atlantis Aquaventure water park. I want to express my gratitude to everyone, and this post is my way of giving back to the community in 2023. I'd like to point out that there have been some notable changes from the posts I read prior to my visit to the water park, particularly in terms of pricing adjustments and the way queues are managed. **PRE-departure** After conducting thorough research and reading various sources, it became apparent that many visitors were able to experience the majority, if not all, of the major slides and rides by arriving at the park right when it opened. Aquaventure opens its doors at 9:45 am, and this information proved to be invaluable. Fortunately, I had a friend with a car, which turned out to be a significant advantage for our journey. We had planned to visit on a Saturday. Knowing that long lines were expected, I was reluctant to pay for the Aquapass to bypass them. Waking up early and being among the first to arrive was the obvious solution. I was staying around International City, so I had to make sure I was up bright and early. The night before our visit, I meticulously prepared by making a checklist of items to take with me. These included extra clothes, sunscreen, towels, lotion, shampoo, and, most importantly, slippers. I also suggest bringing a plastic bag to carry your wet swimsuit, as it can be quite handy. While I initially gathered all this information from my research, I stumbled upon a concerning post about the outrageous cost of food within the park. Some visitors mentioned that Aquaventure offered a meal deal pass at the reception for 70 AED, which raised a red flag for me. To counter this, I decided to eat a substantial breakfast and even prepared a delicious grilled cheese sandwich to take with me. I wasn't entirely sure about the park's security and policy regarding outside food, but I decided to give it a try anyway. The one thing I knew for sure was that you could only bring in a single 500ml water bottle inside the park. **Departure** In the morning, I got up at 7 am, got ready, had a meal of cereal, grilled cheese, and an apple. Most importantly, I packed a grilled cheese sandwich for later. I woke up my friend in the next room, and we left around 9:00 am. The journey was quite pleasant, especially when we reached the areas around Marina and the Palm. I hadn't been to these areas in the last year and a half I've been in Dubai, and the views and architecture were stunning. The trip took about 35 minutes. If you were to take public transportation, it would take 2-3 hours, with the most expensive part being the monorail fee, which I read was 30 AED. **Arrival and Check-In:** Upon our arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to find not many people there at that time. The parking was right in front of the reception. There was a small line of 5-6 people ahead of us, but the staff worked efficiently. My friend paid for the discounted tickets that come with the birthday pass (which allows you to bring two friends who get a 20% discount each). After the discount, he paid 268 AED, and I, of course, got my ticket for free. At the reception, they offered several add-ons for purchase: * Locker: A large locker was priced at 80 AED, while a small one was 55 AED. * Meal deal: This was available for 70 AED. * Aquapass: Priced at 425 AED. * Towel: Could be purchased for 35 AED. My friend, who had concerns about his belongings and didn't plan to eat inside, decided to buy the meal deal(later on) and a small locker(upfront). As for me, I didn't purchase anything, as I felt that lockers were more suited for those with lots of items that wouldn't fit in a single bag or for those with valuable possessions. The reception staff was welcoming and guided us to a shuttle bus that would take us to the waterpark entrance. After a short 5-minute drive, we arrived at the entrance. Upon disembarking, I was surprised to see a significant number of people already in line to enter the park. I began to worry that everything inside would be very crowded. To make matters more challenging, there was a school trip on the same day. It seemed like the kids were quite loud and disruptive, affecting the flow of the crowd. Just before entering the waterpark, there was another counter where you could make final purchases to reconsider your options. It was at this point that my friend decided to buy the meal plan. Fortunately, the line moved quickly as there were seven active counters. Finally, I found myself waiting in line for the security check. The security measures primarily focused on visual bag checks. I had some concerns that they might discover my lunch box, so I cleverly hid it underneath everything in my bag, ensuring that the plastic bag only contained my swimsuit. To my relief, they missed it when they lifted the towel from my backpack. I wasn't sure if it was against the rules to bring outside food, but either way, I successfully managed to bring my own food, and that made me happy. The most horrible part of my experience was undoubtedly the changing rooms and locker areas, both when I arrived and later when I was ready to leave. While these facilities were clean and well-maintained, they were also extremely crowded and uncomfortably humid. I found it quite unbearable, especially given the presence of the loud school field trip students. After changing, I was relieved to get out of the changing room. However, I was informed that if I left my bag outside with any electronic devices, they might overheat. So, I decided to keep it in my friend's locker. As a result, I had to carry my bag with me throughout my time at the park till I got a place to place it, maybe like a lean chair. **During the Visit:** **Part 1 - Pre-Rides and Exploring:** Our first priority after entering was to get swim socks to protect our feet from the scorching hot ground. Next, we secured a spot where we could place our backpack and take a break later on. However, by the time we found chairs, almost all of them were already taken. Based on what I had read, Neptune Tower was rumored to be the most crowded, so we devised a plan to tackle the rides labeled as ""very crowded"" first before more visitors arrived. Unfortunately, this strategy backfired. We wasted a good 25 minutes waiting in line for the famous Leap of Faith on Neptune Tower. The queue was surprisingly long, and it was hard to believe it could be this busy as early as 10:30 am. Nevertheless, we decided to wait and to return later. The Leap of Faith ride turned out to be an adrenaline rush, where you freefall within seconds after getting on. It felt like my soul left my body, and right then, I realized I was inclined toward rides of ""severe levels."" Everything was pretty much as expected. After that exhilarating experience, my friend needed to eat, so we headed to the Barracudas restaurant, where he could redeem our meal deals. As I anticipated, the prices were quite surprising, with the cheapest item being a 500ml water for 15 AED and prices going up to 150 AED. A serving of fries alone cost 40 AED, and a cheeseburger without fries was priced at 70 AED. The meal deal offered a selection of seven food options, all of which included fries and a drink. At best, you probably save a maximum of 15 AED with this deal. My friend chose a shawarma, and it turned out to be quite sizable, with the fries and drink being equivalent to what you'd get at a small McDonald's. After our meal, we decided that it would be a good idea to start by visiting the rides furthest from the park's entrance and then make our way back. We began with the Trident Tower, Poseidon, and Neptune. **Part 2 - Rides and Experiences:** We made a slight change to our plan. Instead of following the original order, we first headed to Poseidon Tower, home to the famous ""Poseidon's Revenge"" ride. In this ride, you step into a standing tube, and suddenly, the floor opens up, sending you into a thrilling free fall. We couldn't resist and did it once more similar before moving on to Trident Tower. While making our way between rides, we discovered there were lazy water streams you could leisurely ride along to reach your next destination. These streams were quite thrilling in their own way. It's important that all the rides have weight limits ranging from 55 to 135 kilograms. Here are the rides I experienced and my opinions on each of them: * **Black Out**: This was by far my favorite. It was the most thrilling ride, and the wait time at Trident Tower was moderate. I enjoyed it so much that I did it twice. * **Leap of Faith**: While this ride was highly thrilling and great, it felt a bit short for my liking, and the wait time was longer. However, the unique feature of sliding through the shark-filled aquarium at Neptune Tower added an exciting element. * **Poseidon's Revenge**: I found this ride very thrilling, and the unexpected aspect of falling while standing was fantastic. It's my second favorite. The wait time at Poseidon Tower was reasonable. * **Unnamed Ride Next Poseidon's Revenge**: This one had a moderate thrill but had no wait time, making it a quick and enjoyable experience. * **Vortex**: I absolutely loved this ride. There was little to no wait, and it took you on a spin before you jumped out, dropping 1.5 meters into the pool at Neptune Tower. * **Falls:** This ride had a moderate wait time, and it took float to do it. I enjoyed it, especially the dark portion of the ride at Neptune Tower. * **Hydra Racer:** This was very fun and thrilling, allowing you to race against three other people. I came in first, and while the wait time was a little above average, it was definitely worth it. * **Medusa's Lair**: It felt like the advanced version of Falls with tighter turns and more G-forces. The wait time was reasonable at Trident Tower. * **Shockwave**: This was the only group ride I did, and it was a great experience overall. The wait time was slightly above average, but it was worth it. When I mention ""above average,"" I'm referring to wait times of around 20 minutes. The longest wait I experienced was for Leap of Faith, which took about 40 minutes. I found that the displayed wait times on the screens tended to be somewhat exaggerated. A posted 60-minute wait felt more like 45 minutes in reality, while Black Out, with a posted wait of 20 minutes, turned out to be only a 9-minute wait. So, don't be discouraged by the posted wait times; you might find that you get on the rides faster than you think. **Returning to Change:** Returning to Locker Room when the staff told us it was closing at around 5:30pm, the sunset was amazing for those who want to see the sunset from the top of the towers. There is a private beach for people who want to chill. I returned to my designated lounge chair where I had left my bag lunch, and to my relief, everything was exactly as I had left it, including my towel, all untouched. I decided to eat my meal somewhat discreetly(at noon), just in case someone noticed. After quickly finishing my meal, I returned to the fun. I came back to collect my things form lounge chair and head to the locker room to change, my feet were sore from all the walking. There were free golf carts available, but they were constantly occupied by elderly visitors and families. Additionally, the field trip kids continued to cause disruptions and were quite loud, though the staff remained patient with them. The changing room turned out to be quite challenging, as there were no available private changing areas, bathrooms, or shower rooms. There wasn't even enough space to stand comfortably. My friend decided to change in there inside, while I opted to put on my t-shirt and changed my swim shorts later in a bathroom situated right outside the counter at the exit where my friend had purchased his meal deal. **Leaving and Departure:** As we were leaving, we decided to visit a picture treasure to check if they had captured our moments. Indeed, they had, and the photos were great. However, the price for just one picture was a steep 125 AED. While you could choose the picture you wanted, you couldn't take a photo of it as there was a camera right in front of you ‚Äì maybe a telescope or some high-tech gadget would come in handy here LOL. The process of leaving the water park was smooth and pleasant. We hopped on the shuttle bus that took us back to the parking area, where we got in the car and headed out. Before we reached our final destination, we made a pit stop at Texas Chicken, where we enjoyed a meal using a coupon we had. DRINK A LOT OF WATER once you get out **Overall Experience:** My experience at the water park was fantastic, and I would rate it a 7/10. It was a great day with some wins and losses. I subtracted a point for the disruptive field trip kids, the crowded and less-than-ideal locker rooms, the high prices of various items, and the long queues for some of the larger group rides. One important takeaway is that, despite the temptation of the Aquapass to skip lines, it may not be necessary. During my visit, I overheard a conversation at the reception where a guest asked about peak seasons. The staff mentioned that the highest peaks were in December, part of November, and January. This information suggests that during less busy times, like my visit, the Aquapass might be worth the expense, especially considering its cost at 425 AED. **What I Did Great:** * I brought my own food to eat inside, saving on expensive dining. * convinced a friend with a car to join me, and we both had a great time. * I managed to experience almost all of the high-thrill slides, making the most of my visit. **Areas I Could Have Improved:** * I wish I had brought a waterproof phone bag, as many people were recording, taking pictures, and sharing their experiences. Having one would have allowed me to capture priceless photos, videos, and live sessions of my own. * I missed out on a ride called ""The Storm"" because it was somewhat hidden, and I only noticed it as I was leaving. That was a bit frustrating. * Initially, I didn't know where to buy the waterproof phone bags, but later, when we were leaving, we discovered where people were getting them. If I had been aware of this option in advance, I could have ordered one from Amazon or Noon, likely at a more reasonable price, ranging from 15 to 30 AED. **Here's some advice** * **Early Start:** Begin your day early at the park's opening time to maximize your experience. * **Meal Plans:** Be cautious with meal plans; sometimes, they might not offer the best value. For instance, a shawarma was priced at 65 AED, while the meal plan cost 70 AED. Consider the individual costs, and remember that bigger doesn't always mean better ‚Äì the fries and drinks may not be as satisfying as you'd hope. * **Waterproof Phone Pouch**: Invest in a transparent waterproof phone pouch. It's incredibly frustrating to have your memorable moments captured by a price tag on a picture. This simple addition can enable you to take your own photos, videos, and more. * **Bring Your Own Food**: While I can't confirm whether it's strictly prohibited, you might try bringing your own food. It's a cost-effective and convenient option. * **Short Wait Times**: Keep an eye out for rides with little to no wait time. Don't solely rely on the displayed wait times, as they can be somewhat exaggerated. * **Aqua Band+ App**: Consider using the Aqua Band+ app to check wait times wherever you are in the park. It can help you plan your day more efficiently",36,2023-10-23 04:09:58,True,True,post,dubai

Also some very minor touch screen issues started popping up. Today i visited the apple store in Dubai mall to get these issues fixed and they told me that this is not a genuine product, the original screen has been replaced. And on top of that it turns out that the phone is a 64GB model and not 256GB.

rcgpsu,F1 meetup in Dubai for season finale,rcgpsu,jameshoward1234,"Guys, I guess there are a lot of F1 fans (both casual and hardcore) in this sub. Many of us are not going to the race for various reasons. As a few people have requested, we can try to arrange meeting up in person this weekend to watch the race with fellow fans at a mutually convenient location. Request you to please fill this survey to gauge the interest in the number of people interested and possible locations where we can watch the race. Re location, please suggest places that are economical and can be convenient to all. [Link to survey](https://forms.gle/xrzCu1W8z6hB6Ad16) Please note that this is not an official meetup endorsed by the mods. Also, there is a possibility that we may not go ahead with the plan for any reason - so please do not call me out if you do not hear from me. Please do not be a troll and fill the survey genuinely. If we decide to go ahead each person pays for what they order (no sharing, tab system) so as to be fair for all. The survey will be open till tomorrow, Friday 12noon, so please cast your vote before then. I will update the post with the results. If anyone is interested in helping to organise / coordinate, feel free to DM me. Edit: Please upvote the post for visibility **Edit 2:** Thanks for the response guys! Seems there is decent interest for meeting up. Summary of the results: * Majority (75%) are ok only for Sunday race with balance 25% ok for either dates. So lets meet for the race on Sunday. * Hoping to get a decent turnout ‚Äì around 12-16. * Overwhelming majority (bar one response) was ok to meet in a place which serves alcohol. * There was no clear majority about location, although more than 50% are ok to meet any place in Dubai. A couple of comments have suggested to keep location close to metro station, so it is convenient to reach. 100% of people are flexible with location (last question), so I am hoping there will not be a lot of drop outs because of location alone. So the plan is on. I will update this post again at 12 noon tomorrow (Saturday) for the venue and details. **Edit 3:** People who have responded to the survey, please dm me for the venue and meetup details.",37,2021-12-09 16:31:35,True,True,post,dubai

uqv61r,Noon warranty claims are a nightmare,uqv61r,eagless62,"Mods removed my post in r/dubai dk why, so gonna try here. Bought a phone (Xiaomi Redmi 9) from Noon last may. I only used it to put my second sim and a few other apps so I don‚Äôt use it much. Phone worked fine for 6 months. Then the phone started hanging like crazy. The screen would lock up and refuse to register any touch inputs and randomly start opening apps and doing things on its own. Judging from the CPU monitor, the CPU would ramp up to 100% and stay there for no reason even after I factory-reset the phone. I then placed a warranty claim in January with noon because it started happening all the time and phone was practically unusable. After I clearly explained the situation in the notes with videos, the repair store just installs new software and sends it back to me. I call up noon saying putting a new software wouldn‚Äôt be enough, I was pretty sure it was some kind of hardware issue, and they assured me that if the same issue happens again, they‚Äôll try for the replacement or refund (I know I wouldn‚Äôt get the refund in any way but a replacement would certainly help). And as expected, the phone started hanging so much few days later, that the phone would randomly open apps and start calling people, and the worst part is I was unable to close call since the touch screen was unresponsive. (I had to apologize to so many people for calling them randomlyüòî). I then placed a second warranty claim in April with clear explanation and videos, only for them to close the warranty claim a week later because the courier never called or came to pick up. Then I called up noon and they opened a new case for me but they didn‚Äôt copy the explanation I wrote from the previous warranty claim (that had videos too explaining the problem), and I clearly told them to please copy or the service center won‚Äôt understand what is going wrong, so obviously the service center didn‚Äôt end up fixing the issue. And again as expected, the phone gets sent back to me with yet another ‚Äúnew software‚Äù. The issue came up again, and now since I am out of warranty, I now have a paperweight of a phone that I just can‚Äôt use. Anyone know what I have to do now since customer service is just not helping at all?",5,2022-05-16 16:47:33,True,True,post,UAE

kyg40r,Fake or refurbished controllers sold in Dubai,kyg40r,VigilanteForFreedom,I've bought 4 Xbox one controllers in the last 10 days from 3 different sellers referenced on the Noon and Carrefour marketplace platforms. All the controllers turned out to be fake or refurbished ones. One even had fake AA batteries (one AA battery shorter by 1 millimetre so not touching the anode/cathode in the controller). I have paid between 200 and 220 dirhams for each of them. I was sceptical when they got delivered. The boxes had been tampered with and resealed several times. One box must have been used like 20 times. It was rotten. Inside the boxes the documentation did not match the serial number of the controller and the batteries were either not included or already inserted in the controller or fake ones. I have bought maybe 30 controllers over my lifetime so I can spot the problems. How is this allowed to happen?

The highways are rarely free except a few hours later in the morning to just before noon. Even with School buses and everything, Ajman roads never used to be this crowded. Even at night after 9:00, the highways are jam packed. The roadworks aren't exactly helping. I get that, once complete, it'll only help the traffic. Yet right now, it's only adding to the chaos. Who's brilliant idea was it to do it everywhere all at once ? If there's roadworks in one sector, people travelling only have to deal with it as long as they're driving there or out.

I am someone who has always been an advocate to support local businesses through Amazon I decided to buy a MacBook Pro from noon, I didn‚Äôt want to buy from a random seller so I made sure the seller was noon. Here‚Äôs where I made a mistake, I clicked on an option to customize the product and added to cart. Little did I know that noon has changed the seller from themselves to a random seller. The worst part is I brought it as a gift for a friend, which ended up being quite embarrassing for me as you could imagine, they opened the box infront of me and instead of a MacBook Pro there was a cut up box with a filthy laptop.. I spent countless hours calling them and communicating with noon support and yet it took them over a month to come to a decision where the investigation says we can‚Äôt do anything. At least give me something for closure, nope, nothing. Now I pretty much wasted countless hours and lost 8k. I‚Äôve spent tens of thousands on noon this year alone, with minimum returns, mostly for very small products. I‚Äôve bought appliances and many large items from noon and 3rd party sellers on noon.

I was not at home as my wife had to go through an emergency c-section a day before so I gave the building security the key to let them keep it inside and install it. They sent a 60cm stove which did not fit the space obviously so instead of contacting me they left it *drumroll please* IN THE HALL IN FRONT OF THE TV. Once I got home, I contacted noon that their advertisement/product description was essentially wrong, which is why I ordered this product and therefore they need to arrange for return of this item. They said ‚Äúofcourse we are so sorry, this is a mistake on our part, we will fix it and someone will contact you for return‚Äù. They fixed the product description the same day, unfortunately I did not take a screenshot of the wrong ad as I thought it‚Äôs a straightforward issue that would be resolved as I was assured by the agent.

Last week I ordered lunch for two using the promocode & for my advantage I had a screenshot of the final amount with the promocode which was 27 bucks. & when I paid I was charged 54 bucks. This had happened because their app had issue. I immediately called them & ask them to cancel the order not becasuse its 25 dirham extra but becuase they cannot show one price at checkout and charge another. Their Customer care was helpless as always. She was like I understand your issue & it is valid but I don't have autherization, please take the food & raise a complaint in the app after that. Which I did, & immediately after I raised the complaint they shut me off by saying I didn't choose the promo-code while checking out. I was like bro, I have attached proof what else you want me to do like screen record every purchase? They kept on rejecting through calls and apps & I went on tweet about this, they wanted me to DM me the issue, which I did with all the screenshots & they still haven't got back to me! I was a premium member and I deactivated when this happened. Again this is not about 25 dirhams for me. I mean Its my hard earn money yes but more than that what irritated me was the way they handled all this issue. They were irresponsible & quick to just shut off the case by putting the blame on the consumer. Pathetic! Edit - immediately after the post u/careemofficial got in contact here & ask for my details again which I gave, 22 hours later they have decided to refund completely! I really hope they would keep their good reputation, I have always been fond of them and their service, misbehaviour by one / two staff can go long way ruining good connection with clients.

1egffov,Noon Warranty Claim on Geepas Product,1egffov,Zestyclose_Ad_488,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share my recent experience with a warranty claim on a Geepas speaker that I purchased from . The speaker stopped working after one year, but luckily, I had a 2-year warranty with Noon. So, I booked a warranty claim. Initially, the process required me to go to the Geepas service center, which is quite far from where I live. I called Noon customer care and, to my relief, they changed it to a house pickup for the warranty claim. Noon picked up the speaker, and Geepas serviced it. However, the issue wasn‚Äôt fully resolved. While the speaker itself was fixed, the remote control wasn't working. I wasn‚Äôt aware the remote had a problem until I got the speaker back. I tested the remote control with my mobile camera to check if the battery was dead, but it seemed to work fine. This leads me to believe there is an issue with the receiver in the speaker. It took about two weeks for them to fix and return it to me, and now I need to go through the entire process again to claim the warranty for the remote control, which is really inconvenient. Is there any way I can request a new speaker or a different model as a replacement instead of going through another lengthy warranty claim process?

1cg1egb,Purchasing from noon,1cg1egb,ShoulderSpecific5786,"Hi everyone, I am asking this quostion here because there are lot of stories i read here like someone get fake apple airpods or getting used produc instead of brand new. Please help Yesterday (28 th april)i ordered a samsung s23 plus 8 gb 256 from noon and it will be delivered on wedness day (1st may 2024. ). When i check the order status today in noon app the product went out of stock (my order is confirmed). Then i noticed a strange thing that this product has only one review because only one customer was purchased from that supplier before. Then i dig to find the seller details but didnt find anything. I got confused and checked in google and i found numerous complaints regardingg gadget purchasing from noon. The reason for buying from this seller was it appeared on top with a tagline ""sale"" and it was the best offer i got from anywhere. (I checked in offline markets in diera also and the price of s23 plus is hiked due to stock shortage ) and the offer was 500 dhs lesser than amazon price. (I got it for 2200 dhs from noon ). Now reading all this news regarding noon poor customer service and fraudulents i got confused. What should i do. Should i cancel the order or wait for the product to be delivered?

17wt3cv,"Please beware of Noon. Noon Customer Service is a nightmare, and it is costing me more than 6000 AED.",17wt3cv,Fit-Set6851,"u/noondotcom customer service is so bad that I can't even explain it, and it's costing me more than 6000 AED. I'm sharing this story to make people aware and help them avoid a situation like mine. I bought a MacBook Pro from Noon for 6000 AED. I received it on 30th Oct 2023, and on the same day, I took it to the Apple Store to buy AppleCare Plus. At the Apple Store, I learned that this MacBook is an old model and not eligible for AppleCare Plus, and it doesn't even have a one-year warranty. On Noon, it was clearly stated by the seller that the MacBook is new and has a one-year warranty. I applied for the return on the same day I received it (30th October). In the meantime, I talked to Apple's customer team in Ireland to understand the issue. They clearly communicated to me that the device is old and that I should contact the seller directly. Apple also guided me on how to check the remaining warranty for the device using the serial number on their official website. The Apple official coverage website showed that it is an old Mac with only 15 days of warranty left. After a few days, a Noon representative came and took the laptop. Now the real drama begins. They completely rejected my return after 7 days, saying that I opened the box and needed to take the device back. ARE YOU SERIOUS? How can a person know that the device is old without opening the box? I asked them if they even checked what my complaint was about and directly told them that I am not going to take back this fraudulent device and that I need my refund. Then one day, their escalation team called and spoke rudely, saying my behavior was unacceptable and that I needed to take the device back. WHAT THE HELL? I gave her a piece of my mind on the call, and she immediately became normal, saying she understands my issue and will escalate it. (She was from the escalation team, but I don't know to whom she is going to escalate it now.) From 6th November onwards, I've been calling them every day, and all I hear is: * ""Yes, we will get back to you."" * ""We have no update yet."" There's no sign from their customer care representative that they are even considering taking this issue seriously. At least give me some timeline, like it will take 20 days or 1 month, but nothing! I also gave them the complete steps on how to check if the device is an old one, which hardly takes 5 minutes, but there's no sense of urgency from their end. I asked if they could give me the contact details of the seller so I could explain the problem if there was any confusion. They told me they don't have the contact details of the seller. (Seriously, you're putting a seller on the e-commerce website without basic details?) I don't know what I will do now, apart from calling them each day and asking for an update, and I guess they will keep treating me like a fool. If you're even considering buying expensive electronics, I would highly recommend choosing a service other than Noon. I seriously don't want someone else's hard-earned money to go in vain and for them to experience this type of mental stress. If anyone can help me out in any way, that would be highly appreciated. \---------------------------------- UPDATE ------------------------------------------------------- Status: Resolved ( Thanks to this community) After posting this here person from noon escalation team contacted me within few hours and took note of my case and understood the problem. This time the person talking was very helpful and within 2 days they processed my refund.",115,2023-11-16 21:55:30,True,True,post,UAE

1hzh99w,Coldplay Abu Dhabi,1hzh99w,meet_meez,"I attended the Coldplay concert yesterday as a GA regular ticket holder, and here‚Äôs my experience and tips. I live in Corniche and took a taxi to Zayed Stadium at 1:30 PM. Public buses are also available to the stadium. Gates for GA entry open at 3 PM, so bring something like paper to sit on near the wall. Use the clean washrooms outside around 2:30 PM. Bring food, order online (e.g., Noon), and carry water to stay hydrated. At 3 PM, the first gate opens, but you‚Äôll queue again until 5 PM. Use this time to sit, eat, and conserve energy. Watching a downloaded movie helps pass the time. Once inside at 5 PM, head quickly to secure a spot near sections C, D, or E, aiming for the first few rows. The view, sound, and interaction with Chris are amazing near section D. Avoid standing behind tall people. Water is handed out in glasses near the stage, so don‚Äôt worry if you run out. The concert ended at 10 PM. I walked to the Nation Towers shuttle bus area, took a bus there, and then got a taxi home. Everything went smoothly.

1802101,Noon or Cartlow for renewed laptop?,1802101,Icytreus15,"Hello. I'm planning to buy a laptop. The laptops I'm looking for are listed in Noon and Cartlow but they are different laptops. The one from Noon is an Asus Zephyrus G14 while the one from Cartlow is an Asus Zephyrus M15. Both are fine for me so it doesn't matter that much which one I should pick but I kinda prefer the G14 since it's slightly portable, but that's not the issue. The issue that I have is the risk when buying from either of them. I'm not sure where I would buy the laptop from. I saw a lot more negative reviews about renewed items from Noon here on reddit but there are also positive reviews. However, I saw a lot more positive reviews in Cartlow and a lot of people are saying that it's legit but there are also negative reviews. However, when I saw how the renewed items are tested in Cartlow, in eases my mind, they have a video covering this. I'm also wondering why they would list these items as renewed. Is it because there was an issue with the devices that's why they had to be renewed? Also, most of the comments I saw was them buying a renewed iPhone and that some parts are not original, like the display. I'm also thinking, could that happen on laptops as well? I thought that it's kinda hard to put not genuine parts on a laptop. I think with the value of these laptops, I cannot go wrong with them because I cannot find other ROG Zephyrus in this price range from other platforms like Amazon. Please help me, which is more reliable? And if you guys bought renewed itemd from either of them, please share your experiences, thank you!",2,2023-11-21 03:08:53,True,True,post,DubaiGaming

1ftcano,Cockroach help‚Ä¶ PLS! ,1ftcano,Mesredi,"**ORIGINAL POST (see bottom for progress):** Okay, so I‚Äôm day 2 in my new apartment and during our initial viewings we didn‚Äôt notice any cockroaches. Low and behold as we eventually move in, it‚Äôs like a cockroach party in here. Now I‚Äôve studied relentlessly (including this subreddit) and realised Advion was the way. So following all correct instructions, I‚Äôve applied advion and am starting to notice a few dead and a lot more activity (12hrs after bait applied) I have the AC on high, have lights all on and have deep cleaned (4 times with different providers!) today. Questions; 1. Is it too early to call pest control? - Would that make the advion less effective as I‚Äôm possibly dampening the tertiary kills? 2. There‚Äôs definitely activity on a gap underneath the extraction fan and they‚Äôre able to move in between cupboards - who do I call out to solve this bad workmanship in the kitchen and more importantly make this apartment watertight against surrounding units to reduce their movement?? 3. Should I admit defeat? Will I always be battling these things? We would lose essentially all our money leaving this apartment and we are so stressed out. 4. Is there anything else I can do while I‚Äôm attempting advion treatment? So annoyed that my purchased furniture (sofa) arrived as I‚Äôm worried that‚Äôs going to be a haven for them to hide in and I‚Äôm so scared to even unwrap my mattress until I‚Äôve cleared them out entirely. # Update 1: *Thanks for the advice all. So we're at the end of day 2 and we have at least sweeped up about 40-50 cockroaches, dead or dying, the advion has made them very visible throughout the apartment, but they're not exactly going at any pace, they're either massively slowed down, dying on their backs or already dead. Advion is proving somewhat successful.* *I have however also started reaching out to pest control to come (as per the top comment on this threads advice) and fumigate post my advion treatment as a final blast to these little things. I think I'm opting for Rentokil, and perhaps the 1 year treatment.* *I am looking into IGRs (such as gentrol) as heard that's good to use in conjunction to stop them breeding. I've also bought flex tape, I don't know how much that'll slow them down but going to line the cupboards where I seem them connect through with white flex tape and perhaps caulk in addition. But first I really want to bring the population down.* # Update 2 *It‚Äôs end of Day 4 since moving into a cockroach infested apartment. The cockroaches haven‚Äôt taken my bribe of British beer and are now starting to leave in disgust.* *Day 3 consisted of a further dead or dying 8-12 cockroaches hanging about on the floors. Great news.* *Day 3 I also had a huge go at my agent, I said we were going out to a hotel and not living in the apartment (this is true, but the hotel is prepaid anyway) he organised quickly a viewing to the apartment and organised pest control, maintenance and further clean. Props to the landlord.* *Day 4 morning after fumigators came in, the apartment showed dead cockroaches around a further 5-7. Totally dead, not even moving. During the day, only one cockroach made itself known.* *I also binned our appliances that came with the apartment. Probably overkill, but they were dirty and we prepare food in this kitchen. Removing the washing machine revealed a slow leak. Cockroaches LOVE the sense of water so that caused some of our issues I suspect.* *So what‚Äôs next? Well I don‚Äôt know, in 2 days we are going to move in. I‚Äôm going to attempt tomorrow to seal gaps, apply more measures (traps and powder) and hopefully by then our cockroach problem will be solved.* # Update 3 It's been 8 days living in a cockroach infested apartment. To date, I've applied a wide variety of solutions. There's roach hotels around the place, they have not caught any (in over 24 hours). Diatamaceous Earth was applied today. Boric Acid gel, which I bought mistakingly on Noon was applied in some problem areas also. I've also had all my new appliances moved in and we are now fully living in the place. Thinking the problem was gone. Was the problem gone? No. No it hasn't. This building, although it looks nice, has a massive infestation problem. Unfortuanately, I may have killed what's called the breeding population, but I have seen 2 cockroaches WITH eggs still after all these measures. What does this mean? Well, I'm likely to continue to see more. I spoke to my neighbour today, he's fighting the same battle I am. He suspects a neighbour, but I suspect a floor wide infestation in the walls, that yes started from a neighbour, but could've been anyone. Now I sit contemplating. Is it time to consider moving? Well that's not an option, with all the expenses of buying appliances, furniture etc. It's just not possible for me to afford to lose security deposit and 2 months rent on top of all of this expense. We would have to definitely downgrade to studio. So now we live amongst cockroaches. German Cockroaches. My advice? Don't move into a building with German Cockroach infestation, it will ruin your life. P.S: I won't say what the building is obviously, but hold vigilance with renting an apartment in JLT, check for signs of serious infestations. # UPDATE 4 It‚Äôs been about a month since moving in, and I am now considered cockroach free (1 sighting in past over 3 weeks) What do I put it down to? I don‚Äôt know, but here is my order of things that seemed to work the best. 1. Pest Control Pay a pest control company, it‚Äôs worth it and will make an effect. 2. Advion This brought down numbers the quickest, but not to zero - so I added the following two after 10 days of Advion (DO not use traps in conjunction - u want them to go back to harbouring areas alive. 3. Diatamaceous earth We bought new appliances, it was important they didn‚Äôt start harbouring in there so a HEAVY application of diatamaceous earth behind appliances and near drain entries. 4. Paying maintenance guy Caulk ALL obvious entries - like washing machine pipe entry etc - this helps I think. 5. Glue traps Glue traps are down for 2 weeks now, only 1 cockroach found on one.",6,2024-10-01 05:25:43,True,True,post,dubai

ll3oep,Why Advertising Industry in the region is still in 80's ?,ll3oep,startuphameed,"1. There is hardly any original creativity in the region. 2. Most of the TV ads are either pathetic adoption ( read: same stuff with regional models and language translation) of the international versions or visual of ""smiling family spending time together"" 3. Press ads are adoptions too with some rare local ads with copies that are relevant to 1980. 4. Online ads are ancient too. Rarely we see some quirky copy from noon and Talabat. Otherwise, it's all straight "" Buy grocery"" ""Order food"" lines with ""huge logo"" 5. The ""arrangement"" between Publishers, media buying agencies, advertising agencies, PR agencies, and marketing heads will put even African politicians to shame. The client company is paying the price, mostly. This is prevalent in other countries too. But nothing like it here 6. Media cost is way beyond global standards. For example, Movie advertising - a 400 seat screen charges 50,000 for 30 seconds ad for a month. 75K is it is just before the movie. Top Hollywood movies are excluded from the deal. 7. The bridge billboard that you see in Shiek Zayed road costs 180-250K per month. 8. The TV advertising price is over the roof. There is hardly any reach for the content beyond sports and news. Yet, one can't do anything on TV without a few million $. 9. Youtube is the TV alternative for the region and GCC is youtube's most expensive market when it comes to ads. 10. A half-page newspaper ad is AED 50K in newspapers here with a max of 10,000 readers. 11. Most regional online publications manage to sell their online inventory at $30-50 dollars to agencies who push it to clients 12. Radio ads of 30 seconds cost \~AED 1000 per spot. 13. Agencies charge a retainer fee of \~200K/month from clients and charge extra for what they call ""work"" 14. Agency commission on media is 15% even in 2021. 15. Ad Spend is down 50% in the past 5 years - according to an ArabianBusiness story. 16. Google and Facebook take more than 50% of the ad spend. The regional advertising Industry folks are just potential jobseekers in these companies and would never challenge their game. 17. Google, Facebook, Insta, Twitter every damn platform have a ""special price"" for the region to fund EMEA regional operations. I have not seen their employees trying to help anyone. I have made it a practice to interact with Google and Facebook team members from Asiapacific ( India, Singapore) to get work done. 18. On top of all this, we have this new breed of Influ\*\*nkers, through which PR firms and advertising agencies have found a way to rip-off clients. The fee for a post/2 minute video ranges from AED 50-200K + loads of freebies. What do you think are the reasons behind the lack of creativity and lack of quality and value in the advertising Industry here?",100,2021-02-16 17:22:30,True,True,post,dubai

l3fzaa,Advice needed re power abuse by my building management company,l3fzaa,am-89,"What can I do as a tenant if my building (Elite Residence in Marina) continues to stop all delivery staff whether it's food, medicine, couriers (amazon, noon etc) from delivering to apartments? This has been ongoing since March 2020 and it's the only building I know of that continues to do that. It's completely inconvenient having to go downstairs every time you have a delivery, especially if you're working from home or have a conference call or have a guest over or have kids. Their justification is ""health precautions"" but that's obviously bs because they're a complete disaster in other building management aspects (billing, security etc), and letting the tenants of a 700-apartment building go downstairs to collect their stuff is surely riskier than allowing delivery staff go upstairs using the ONE service lift that is dedicated to them. I thought of collecting signatures from other tenants and handing them to the owners' association or to some sort of authority (RERA or whoever handles these matters) but I'm not sure if that will get me anywhere. I hate how they're abusing their power and I want to do something about it. Any tips or suggestions would really really be appreciated. UPDATE: For those who've been taking the building's side and claiming that the management is doing the right thing towards the health of tenants, I'd like to tell you that I found out today that the building hasn't followed the recent Covid protocol update on increasing the distance between gym equipment to 3 meters.

qv5xhz,[Feedback] Difference between Noon and Amazon,qv5xhz,hamad3914,"Hello, Thought I would share some of my experience with Noon and Amazon based on purchases made from both for ""Sold by Amazon"" and ""Express"" and sold by Noon items. **Checkout Process:** The ordering page and layout is much more intuitive on phone, a number of options are confusingly placed on their checkout page and is way easier with Amazon. **Delivery times:** Amazon is way more accurate than Noon. They give you an exact date whereas on Noon you get a time period of 2-3 days. Same thing happens when an item is shipped, Amazon tells you arriving today or tomorrow but noon says ""Today - Tomorrow"". This is really the major difference where noon who use their own delivery system cannot even accurately define timelines and Amazon who uses 3rd party delivery (at least almost always in my case) are more accurate. **Support:** This is a two-way thing. Amazon has a slight edge as they have chat support now but no direct email unlike noon who you can reach out on email. Plus they also hear people out on Reddit so that's a plus. Although dealing with Noon on email was more challenging and response is slow. **Products:** Both have fairly large collection but Noon seems to work better when searching and doesn't push sponsored and suggested products first. Although filtering can be a little difficult but with Amazon you can always find a better price for various products when you filter and sort correctly. The option to also club shipments works only 1/5 times for me and usually get most items separately from Noon. With Amazon in many cases items are clubbed even if they were a different order placed on same day. Overall, my experience with Amazon is way better and every time I now order from Noon I feel that something will go wrong.",6,2021-11-16 15:38:33,True,True,post,dubai

You only told me about this 3 days(the day of delivery) after I made my order instead of next day 3. You tried to make me pay an extra 100aed for your mistake and I also had to way another 3 days for delivery 4. Customer service gave me no answer to whether you are refunding me or delivering the product or any information regarding next steps 5. I had to email twice to get an actual response 6. You sent an email to say the product was going to be delivered yesterday 7. Nothing came, no phone call for apology, no email, nothing. I had to email and complain again 8. I received 2 calls to confirm and personally promise that my product would be delivered today at 9pm 9. It's past 9pm, no delivery, no calls nothing 10. I called customer service who said they will check on the status of the delivery and call back in 30mins 11. It's past 10pm, now still nothing 12. I call again and ask for a supervisor. Waiting around 15 mins for he person to come back and say a supervisor will call me back 13. I refused to hang up, 10 mins later I get a supervisor on the phone 14. Supervisor reads through the account details and asks me for 10mins to call inventory and get back to me. I refused 15. They again start promising things and I'm just here thinking well I talked to 5 different people and they all promised things and they all failed to deliver 16. Supervisor asks me what do I want to do and I inform them that it's really their job to make these decisions and deal with problems. It's not my job to deal with these issues on your behalf 17. I tell them that it's over refund me and I'm filling complaints against the company 18. I literally tell them that my community doesn't allow deliveries after 10pm and that I don't want to talk or recieve any more calls from noon. I say goodbye and hang up 19. Supervisor calls me back after 1 mins. Are you serious ? 20.

Is there such a thing here for placing on Noon etc without him actually having to be a resident/trade license. A third party company that takes on products to sell on marketplaces and just takes commission? Thanks for any help.,1,2023-08-14 21:01:19,True,True,post,dubai

OK, these things happen, so I immediately requested a return with refund. It took Noon almost one month to manage to send me someone to take back the stuff, only after I raised a complaint. So I thought this story was over, but I had a refund notification which doesn't include the AED 10 delivery fee I paid in the first place.. It is only 10 dirhams I know, but I find it to be a pretty poor customer policy! It was not a return because I changed my mind or something like that, but because Noon is not able to control what its sells..

There was a random sticker kept on top of the phone with an IMEI number. \- The sim card slot is on the top of the phone instead of where it should be on the bottom. \- The phone has fingerprints and dirt on it. There is dirt visible inside the power button. \- The phone is not starting after being connected to the charger. \- There is a dent on the phone. \- The S pen is fake also, it looks different. The tip of the S pen in an original should be pointed, but mine has a flat tip. Also the mechanism to remove the S pen is different. On the original, you have to click to release the pen after which you can pull it out.

fwociw,Some experience on some local eCommerce sites in light of their recent performance facing Covid-19 #Stayhome,fwociw,HappyIsSimple,"This is biased and based on my personal experience, mostly composing of my rants towards Noon. ***Noon.com*** As a relatively new platform with large number of 3rd party sellers, I believe Noon.com could have done better. In earlier days, before Covid-19 causing these pains, Noon was doing okay in my opinion. Not the best, but at least adequate. I was buying a lot from Noon a while ago, most orders went without issues. There were problems like what was posted in this sub: cancelling orders without refunding the amount directly to our credit card, some concerns over product quality, but not deal breakers. All up until these days, their order fulfilment seems more problematic as compared to Amazon. Heard that they couldn't receive products from sellers for QC anymore due to capacity issues. Even for the things that sellers succeeded in handing over, took them way too long time to process. What I see from this: \- buyers place orders \- sellers might have the orders ready but could not get it accepted in Noon warehouse, or send out their products but stuck in Noon warehouse for who knows how long. \- buyers never getting their orders but they got charged already. \- angry buyers asking for refunds and order cancellations. \- upset sellers received returned items after 1 months or 2 adding pressure to their inventory level and warehouse capacity. \- Noon as the platform loses confidence among buyers and 3rd party sellers as a whole. Maybe the increase in orders, inadequate warehouse capacity and probably the complex order fulfilment process they designed all led to the current situation. Seems they might need to do more for remedies in future. ***Firstcry.ae*** This is a new one for me. Bought something on it for my little one, and got surprised with their "" Try-N-Buy "" option. Don't know if any other eCommerce sites or APPs in this part of the world can do this, but it was a great option. We ordered 3 pairs of shoes and only 1 pair fits, which we paid for and kept. Product pricing looks okay overall. One downside is their coupon system. The rules for using those coupons are quite harsh and excluding most of the things we actually need. Ended up giving up this coupon. But besides that, all seemed fine to me. ***Amazon.ae*** Quite good on buying essentials, if they have stock. But then you need to keep an eye on where the sellers are shipping from and avoid those with super long processing times. It was safe to buy from Amazon.ae themselves as sellers. But my recent orders were delayed for a few days as well. ***Carrefour*** It used to be a really good option to buy groceries. Usually delivering next day, never had to worried. Now I guess it might be because more people are buying from them online, taking way too long to deliver. Customer service is not easy to get to if you need to contact them. ***Kibson*** Tried for the first time. Delivered on scheduled day when I thought it wasn't gonna arrive. Just some items were out of stock. Can't pay directly with credit card, had to recharge into their wallet system and pay from there, something not very user-friendly. Still trying more eCommerce sites these days. What else can we do at home right?",5,2020-04-07 21:13:18,True,True,post,dubai

The phone charged from 2% to 6% in 30 minutes. I returned it too noon and got refunded, I‚Äôve ordered the same phone from a different seller now. Is there a way to complain to noon about the seller?

UPDATE: The phone from the second seller has the same charger. Wow. I‚Äôve gone 4 days without a phone now. Looks like this scam is running all over Noon.

End of May 2021 (back then I was not so sure that noon is this horrible) there was some promotion like if you're buying using some particular credit card, you will get 15% cashback extra after 15 Days of delivery. Anyway, I had to buy some stuffs and I thought ok, I can utilize the extra cashback, so I had placed an order. Multiple items, total of DHS 2.3k! After 15 days - nothing, 30 days - nothing, 45...60...90...NOTHING. I casually called customer care as I had already lost hope and asked about this and she ""assured"" me it will be done within 48 hours. Again, nothing... At this point I knew nothing is going to happen as I was telling this experience to one of my colleague, and they said I can complain about this on the DED portal. I created a complaint on DED and noon called me next day and the again said, they will process the cashback as a ""goodwill gesture"" and it has been approved from management, it will be credited by tomorrow. Hmm... ""Goodwill gesture"" now!! Next morning DED called and closed the case as I said that yes, I got a call from Noon, and they said they will process the cashback. Noon did not even process the cashback still after that and when I called the customer service, he said ""this is weird, I can see it is approved from management, but I am not sure why noon pay is not processing this, can you email noon pay or call them?"", I was like haha WTF is going on. Then I was so pissed and now adamant to get my cashback, I created one more complaint, emailed noon, noon-pay and DED on the same email mentioning all the details. Very next day, around 1 PM, I saw that the cashback was credited. Finally!! I promised myself, no more noon, and I am now ordering grocery from them to utilize the cashback amount and soon as I hit zero, bye bye noon, see you!!! &#x200B; Tldr - noon promised it will process extra cashback after 15 days; never did after 90 days ; involved DED and after evading once, finally they credited the cashback.",15,2021-10-27 18:56:53,True,True,post,dubai

pjk2ti,Dubai First Cash Back Credit Card,pjk2ti,novacosma,"So I'm looking for cash back credit cards and have been reading the review for Dubai First. There seems to be two categories of reviews: 1. (Loud majority) People who thought it was a free card or were pushed to get it, then there was an annual fee and they felt screwed, couldn't talk to customer service, got annoyed etc. 2. (Silent minority) People who get thousands in cash back every year and are happy with it. It almost seems to good of a deal, tbh, and usually that means that it ***is*** too good to be true: 1. 399 AED annual fee 2. 250 AED signing bonus credit (so first year annual fee ends up being only about 50 AED) 3. 5% cashback on online purchases including school fees but excluding Government Transactions, Real estate, Insurance Sales, Underwriting, and Premiums, Duty Free stores, Service Stations (with or without Ancillary Services), Automobile and Truck Dealers - Sales, Service, Repairs, Parts, and Leasing. 4. 5% cashback on groceries & supermarkets 5. 1% cashback on all other AED transactions Most importantly: no minimum spend and no cashback limit. I have been asking the sales rep a million times and in writing and he confirms it. The terms & conditions mention no limit either. Just on groceries that would mean around 2,000 AED cashback a year. My school fees would bring up to 2,500 AED cashback a year. Can't even calculate how much it'd be from Amazon, Noon, Talabat, etc. but I guess also in the range of 2-3,000 AED cashback/year. Seems like a no brainer almost but would like to hear some feedback from actual users. I also know it's quite similar to the FAB Cashback card but the main differences seem to be: 1. FAB has a limit of 500 AED on supermarket cashback, DF doesn't, but rate is the same - 5%. However, I don't spend 10,000 AED/month on groceries so that's fine. 2. FAB gives 5% on utility payments (250 AED limit) (except telecommunications), DF gives 1% (since it's government transaction). 3. FAB gives 5% on fuel (250 AED limit), DF gives 1%. 4. FAB only gives 1% on online transactions (except for Supermarket), DF gives 5% on online transactions including school fees. For utility payments right now I'm using Mashreq which gives back 20% up to 50 AED for first 6 months but considering 5% on utility payments and fuel, I think after the 6 months with Mashreq is up, it'd be a perfect combo to also get the FAB cashback card to cover it all.",0,2021-09-07 14:04:11,True,True,post,dubai

gx2b2o,Recent Ejari renewal exeperience,gx2b2o,wittynameloading,"I recently renewed my Ejari and thought I'd share my experience. Firstly, I did the lease renewal through the agency that helped me find the flat in the first place. Honestly, it was a painstaking experience but we got there in the end. They told me that I could renew the Ejari through the DubaiRest app (but that it would require the landlord to download and approve the renewal) or in person with a colour copy of the tenancy contract. Of course, they didn't offer to coordinate with the landlord to download the app and approve the renewal, and I didn't have the energy to even ask. Note. I tried in vain to do the renewal via the app and it didn't work. In case you've tried via the app, be sure to cancel the request before going to register/renew in person. I checked on the Dubai Municipality website and saw that the Al Manara Centre was open Sunday - Thursday from 8.30am - 2.30pm for Ejari matters. There are a few other centers, but I'm slightly more familiar with the Al Manara Centre. I took the day off (to run various errands) and ended up at Al Manara Centre at around noon. I completely missed that there was an Al Manara Centre parking and parked on the street and headed to Gate 1 which was closed. Turns out for Ejari matters you need to head to Gate 3 where they check your temperature and let you in. From there, I went to the reception desk who checked my docs (all that's needed for the Ejari renewal is a colour copy of the tenancy contract, landlord's passport copy and tenant's original EID. You also need AED 210 - there's a cash machine by Gate 1 in case you don't have cash). From there I was sent to the first floor where I gave reception my mobile number and they texted me a token number. There was about a 10 minute wait then my number was called. I handed over the documents, they cancelled the request I had done via the app (as above, try to do this before you get to the counter to avoid delays), I paid the money, scanned my thumbprint and was sent back to the ground floor reception to get the renewal documents stamped, and that was it.

Keep in mind - I am educated, my eyes work perfectly, I can read english and not only that, I can also comprehend english. (It's important for this) Each ride promises you a 10 percent cashback without a cap. And so I decided to go to Sir Bani Yas - 900 aed cab ride hoping Id get a 10 percent cash back. Upon raising this to their so called dedicated customer service team - they dismiss this and say you only will get 7 aed as cash back. Because rides have a cap of 7 aed on Hala and 10 on careem rides. 1) Now - Nowhere on the app does it say there is a cap. 2) Nowehere in the user journey while buying this subscription, will you see the terms and conditions where it says there is a cap of 7 aed. 3) I asked the customer service to guide me on the App - like guys it's your app, so show me where in the app it says there is a cap. They themselves struggled to do so. My key learnings: 1. There are better platforms than Careem. The more you spend time on this app, the more you realise they not increasing the quality of service, but incrementally making you pay more. Repeat business is expensive (for the consumer) 2. Noon has a way way better (not the best) but way better service. 3. Bolt, Yango are much better cab options. 4. I don't need cash back to feel great, but I need promises to be delivered upon. 5. My hope is - the consumer court. I have raised a formal complaint. Update: They realised the mistake and sent me 19 aed back which is the exact amount I paid for the subscription. :)",11,2025-01-12 15:56:11,True,True,post,dubai

fdshqi,"I'm looking to buy an ""international"" model phone",fdshqi,Zaekr211,"tl;dr: want to buy an import phone from noon/amazon third party seller. yay or nay? Hi all, My phone (iPhone 6s) has been on the verge of dying soon and I've been eyeing the Samsung Galaxy S10e because of all the features it's packed into a compact size as well as the inclusion of the earphone jack (otherwise I'd have stuck to the iPhone). One of the main selling points of it for me is that it is available in the color yellow, which happens to be my favorite color (to the point where it's kind of become an inside joke in my circle). Anyway, the issue is that the yellow color is not available in the UAE; they only sell black and white, which are overdone IMO. Amazon and Noon have them for sale from third-party sellers. On Amazon, it is labelled as international model but costs a few hundred more. I've checked the connectivity of all regional models of the phone and they all are compatible with Etisalat (as far as I can tell anyway). My questions: * Would it be advisable to buy/import a phone (from a third-party seller at that) ? * Has anyone had any experience importing a phone (in terms of region locking)? * Which would be more reliable between Amazon and Noon? I've not tried Amazon AE after it replaced Souq. Have not tried Noon either. The phone on both sites is being sold by different folk. I'm not very familiar with the smartphone markets and compatibility, so I'd appreciate any input. Thanks in advance :)",1,2020-03-05 12:50:31,True,True,post,dubai

Nothing seemed unusual, this isn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs gotten something like that. Naturally, the first thing he did is check the rera calculator to see if can dispute the increase. Turns out he could, so he sends in a screenshot of the rera calculator saying they can‚Äôt increase rent. This is where things get interesting..

Not fully satisfied, he calls the same person to verify that he sent the email, and it turns out he didn‚Äôt! It was scammers. The first email sent was legitimate, but somehow scammers intercepted it and sent the following emails from the exact same address! That‚Äôs right, the emails addresses looked exactly the same.

Leaving aside the asinine design of the site, nothing was even deliverable in less than 3-4 days, half of the stuff I wanted weren‚Äôt available. We‚Äôre talking stuff costing less than 50 Dhs here. Checked out noon and tried ordering 15 items in a go worth 1000 Dhs. I got a flat discount of a 100 Dhs and the items were delivered in 2 days. And a voucher with a discount code for the next order. Impressed with their speed and packaging which didn‚Äôt involve ripping giant boxes usually 20x the size of the items being shipped. And most of all I‚Äôm very happy that noon has decided to take on amazon and bring real competition in the segment. So here‚Äôs wishing noon the best, you guys are doing a fabulous job and I really like the app design with the yellow motif. The app does a fantastic job of showing the right items and most of all, it just works. If the noon team is reading this, the only part where you need to step up is to provide real time updates of the item being shipped. I guess this is already in the works.",25,2019-05-15 20:34:11,True,True,post,dubai

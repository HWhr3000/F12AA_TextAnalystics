1ewr4tx,DONT Buy Any Warranty Product from NOON.com,1ewr4tx,Particular-Ride-633,"i just faced very very bad experience with Noon.com. I had purchased Apple Renewed - iPhone 12 Pro Max from Noon with 1year Warranty. The Product grade was Premium (top rate) and when i start using it, i faced touch issue. and very soon its batter got swellen and screen came out. When i raised warranty Claim, initially they refused to cover under warranty, as as per them it was with 6months warranty, but since i had raised claim within 6month of period, they agree to take the phone for repair. They were kept delaying it and since delay, the screen which had come out due to battery swellen issue, it got crack and because of this crack reason, they found excuse and didnt repair the phone. I had shared the picture and video as initail stage and there was no crack, and since they took 6weeks to pick the phone, the batter swellen issue caused the damage in screen which they didnt repair, not even battery and returned the phone opened. i recommend everyone, DONOT buy anything from #noon other wise be ready to face such issues. they were very very unethical, unprofessional who knew that the phone issues are under warranty, phone is under warranty, still they tried their level best to make me fool that phone is not under warranty and cannot be repair and at last, they returned the phone opened.",1,2024-08-20 13:24:37,True,True,post
1cvwbpb,Harassment by Noon.com and it's return policy - May 2024,1cvwbpb,Disastrous_Note_5024,"UPDATE (20th of May 2024) I apologize for not paying close attention to Noon’s return policy. It is clearly stated that opened items cannot be refunded, as Noon cannot resell or return them afterward. Thank you for all the comments and to the Noon help center for clarifying this policy. This rule applies to returns in the UAE ///////////////////////////////////// Good day everyone, Following up on the problem discussed in post ""Harassment by Noon and it's return policy"", in which Noon refused to refund a customer for a product that doesn't fit, I'd like to tell my story with them. So, I ordered a Samsung S22 Ultra on the 11th of May at noon for AED 1,945. The product was delivered on the 17th of May, in the evening, with the box already damaged. This is not a major problem, however in context. After checking the phone in the evening of the same day, I examined it more closely and realised that it is not suited me as a gadget. I decided to return the product in the same condition as was (no scratches, no missing parts) - Photo 1 [Photo 1. Condition of the phone which I returned](https://preview.redd.it/4nuilqdunf1d1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=311fc845bbe9d8ddb871ddab357ed1d0f100293a) So I create a return request without any hindsight. Yes, I opened the box, but everything else was original. And I make the refund request the same day I received it (17th of May). The next day the courier picks up the phone and the request starts to be fulfilled - Photo 2 https://preview.redd.it/vz5w8pp70g1d1.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=d69690c51ab37e5848bd902c6cdcfa33443a8dac Today - 19 May - they send me a notification that the item cannot be returned because the box has already been opened. Every shop *(not really, I think only Amazon are being very nice about their returns policy right now, however they can't officially return opened goods either)* in the UAE is willing to refund If you have bill and do so within 15 days of purchase Noon refuse to me in this return - Photo 3 https://preview.redd.it/morgoa190g1d1.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=70ab57d4bdd0de10f22ec5c26d2121e3f54d904b As a result, product returned to me with no potential availability to reimburse money Generally it is rule of all stores, but in Europe usually it is a little bit different, that is why I thought the same rules applicable her * Amazon officially will not return product which is opened - however most of the case they agree to do it - [https://www.amazon.ae/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKM69DUUYKQWKWX7](https://www.amazon.ae/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKM69DUUYKQWKWX7) * Samsung, SharafDG, Jumbo does not allow to return opened product * Apple Store officially will return product in 15 days Be attentive during ordering expensive products, otherwise you will not be eligible for return.

As soon as he got it, he told me that there is a hissing noise from the left bud. So since its under warranty, I took it up straight to apple store. They were too shocked. Holding it even they couldn’t figure it out its fake, however, once they ran a diagnostic test, they realised its not even an apple product. They were quite shocked and adviced me not to get such items from noon, because its an absolute best fake that you wont even realize. Even the packaging, everything looks so real. So then I raised a complaint with Noon, and finally they took back the item and I got refunded. But I have decided not to order such items from Noon.

1exj13k,The Smartphone has become the super app - UAE Perspective,1exj13k,startuphameed,"We are seeing many Super App attempts from the UAE. The most prominent ones are Careem, Botim and Smiles. There are at least 30 other not-very-popular attempts. I am making an attempt to discuss the scope of super apps in the UAE, influenced by a recent story I read. I read [this story about the Indian app Hike and how it failed in a popular startup and business publication, The Morning Context](https://themorningcontext.com/internet/the-forgotten-lessons-of-hike-part-iii) from India, known for doing long-form beautiful stories covering startups and other businesses. ( It is behind a paywall that I couldn't crack). This brilliant business journo Harveen Ahluwalia's story outlines how our smartphones have become the super app and how it resulted in this whole smart-app discourse getting derailed now. The story is about a high-investment ( upward of a billion $ from VCs like SoftBank, etc.) attempt to build a super app in the style of WeChat, Line, etc., that eventually failed. For the contest, Botim is making a similar attempt here. Let's look at the other super app play relevant to Dubai. Gojek, the Indonesian app, cracked this code to make people consume a lot of services within their platform. Supposedly, the first Unicorn from Indonesia eventually became a decacorn. The founder, Nadeim, a Harvard grad and McK alumni, even became a Minister of education and technology in Indonesia. A fun fact is that they had their entire tech, product, growth, marketing etc in India. Flights from Delhi/Bangalore to Indonesia are always filled with Gojek employees. They turned into a super app by around 2016 with many services offered to the users who used bike-taxi and cab services, becoming this one-place-for-all app. I observed high adoption for this product when I visited Indonesia. They went public. But here's the catch. They had to merge the business with Tokopedia, the noon equivalent of Indonesia, to go to IPO. [They opened at IDR 442 on 14th April 2022 and are currently trading at IDR52. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOTO.JK/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIFOSY1H7XMk3yZiPGfwEA2h0MSll_1zv4qKIMzP5Ye_FYUmPdlM2plICNoE3Hfv2xM9Det6TfTmw7ZHH0cTi8kPiFdaRsUeTcnufUuOlPZWpE9sAmRUDrjYLFCk0me9nX0IP62AQcpSfAa2--Un56jeKmO0vCVqb6mTMaeFMGL6) Many have attempted to clone this across the world and mostly have failed so far There are a lot of attempts to crack this play in UAE by botim ( following the WeChat & Line model), smiles and many others. However, Careem is making one prominent attempt. Careem split only this business from Uber to become an independent entity, with Uber retaining a stake and Etisalat investing in the business for equity. For Careem, this model is a straight fit since Gojek also originated from Cab hailing. So, it is a pixel-to-pixel and ppt slide to ppt slide clone. They have experience in doing 100% cloning earlier when they cloned Ola, the Indian cam aggregator's business model, app etc and ended up winning. I also heard that the whole product was built in Bangalore. ( Not taking the credit away.... full marks for execution, and So the guess is that they are masters of cloning. The super apps idea worked for Gojek because it was relevant in an era when, way back in 2014, it was difficult to add and store a payment card in an app, and the devices also lacked space for many apps. Their share trading at only 13% of their IPO launch value validates this truth. So, what is the future for UAE's super apps? Can they beat the conclusion derived from past performance data in different regions? But the most relevant conclusion is what the story I mentioned outlined - **SmartPhone is the super app now** - What is your opinion on this ? PS: I don't want to undermine Careem's mammoth execution capability. I wish them good luck, but from what I have observed, they may be finding it extremely difficult to crack this code.",6,2024-08-21 11:00:06,True,True,post

Getting hacked randomly but not recieving any OTP (you ALWAYS recieve an SMS when trying to log in) Just googling about noon hack will give you many results Now for the past few months, I have been receiving scam sms messages from numbers from countries all around the world. All of them are some fake sms claiming to be from Saudi Post and say you have an undelivered package. Then they ask you to pay ""1.13SAR"" but in reality someone was robbed off of 12,000 RIYALS!! Now what does that have to do with Noon? I posted the screenshots on r/saudiarabia and many users claimed the same thing happening to them! Guess what everyone had in common? All of them had noon accounts. Even my friend was affected by this spam Now there is definite plausibility that noon is responsible for an insecure database since how do you get hacked on noon and soon after start getting spam messages? That too alongside the correlation of people who are getting spam texts with people who have noon accounts Extra Info: I had my noon account compromised. And since I do not use noon regularly, I forgot the password. What do you do? You hit forget password, get an email, and reset the password. What about noon? THERE IS NO FORGET PASSWORD OPTION. You can only reset it provided you remember the old one. Else what? Else you're fucked, support cannot do anything. Your account is in the hands of a malicious individual and you cannot do anything TLDR: Noon is incredibly insecure and is leaking their phone number database.

During this event, the UAE will enjoy its longest day of the year, featuring 13 hours and 48 minutes of daylight. According to Ibrahim Al Jarwan, Chairman of the Emirates Astronomical Society, the solstice will position the sun directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer, resulting in minimal shadows at noon in the southern UAE and shorter shadows across the Arabian Peninsula. Daytime temperatures are expected to range between 41-43°C, with nighttime temperatures between 26-29°C under dry conditions. The first half of summer will see these conditions persist, while the latter half, from August 11 to September 23, will bring increased humidity and the arrival of moist Kos winds, likely leading to thunderstorms.",40,2024-06-09 13:20:53,True,True,post

As soon as this happened another delivery rider tried to slow down carefully but his bike also slipped and he fell.

Turns out another noon delivery guy slipped. Its that damn bricked road. My request to folks from motor City is to not order during a rainy day.

I'm planning to move there given the extreme rental increases across, DH2 is still justifiable comparing to what you get.

I have been checking and can see many of the restaurants I love and usually order do deliver through Careem from Motor City and there is also Noon 15 mins grocery and Instashop. 2- Is it truly a nightmare if you need to get a service provider? for example if I do need some maintenance works done? or if I need to get a pet groomer 3- In terms of distance, yes I do understand the location and how far it is, but I have been comparing it with current travels and I don't require to go to work every day, so I think that should be ok. But in terms of traffic during off peak times from Downtown to DH2 any thoughts? And if anything else comes to mind please let do share. Thank you for your time.",9,2024-10-28 09:12:02,True,True,post

D2C E-Commerce in Mainland (Ownership of Goods is with your (FZ) company):** **FZ companies can't import directly into mainland (correct?)** **Also FZ companies can't deliver directly to individual consumers in mainland (correct?)** **Solution:** Hire a clearing agent to import your goods from FZ/Overseas to mainland and transfer ownership of goods to your company finally. Store goods in subleased WH and fulfil last mile delivery through a courier agent. **(correct?)** **2) Buying from a local company in mainland and selling to another local company in mainland:** **Solution:** Simply follow Order/Invoice/Payment process with both companies, delivery of goods need to happen thorough logistic partner, can’t be delivered by FZ company. **(correct?)** \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* **Original Post:** Hi, There is so much ambiguity online & confusing advice about Freezone Companies operation with businesses in mainland. Title explains, seeking for advice/info from actual business owners of FZ companies, who are already doing business with mainland companies on how it works. (I intend to have a General Trading License in Meydan FZ and work with Mainland/External companies B2B only & plan to sell some stuff online via AMZ/Noon. In mainland or FZ, I don't plan to lease a physical office and/or rent a Warehouse with Ejari in my company name or plan to open a Physical Store or work with Govt depts., hence not opting for Mainland General Trading License due to high cost). I know there are 1000's of FZ companies doing business with mainland companies and how they do is as below, What I have gathered till now by from various people/companies/internet. Please validate as true or post correction where applicable: **1. D2C E-Commerce in Mainland (Ownership of Goods is with your (FZ) company):** **FZ companies can't deliver directly to individual consumers in mainland (correct?)** So, you can sublease a fulfillment Centre or Warehouse in mainland **(can we?)**, can have your own website selling your stuff **(can we?)** and/or can list in Amazon/Noon etc.,. The order from your website/AMZ/Noon goes to WH/Fulfillment Centre, they or your hired courier company deliver last mile to individual customers in mainland, your inward inventory & sold is tallied and you get your sales amount directly in your business bank account from your website/AMZ/Noon. (in any case FZ company/person simply can't take a Van/Car and deliver the goods by themselves to customer in mainland) **Also FZ companies can't import directly into mainland (correct?)** Then to get your goods to that WH/Fulfillment Centre, you need to:: **a) Your Own Imported Goods** \- Issue order to your supplier in China etc., pay them directly from your Business Bank Account. then either **a1)** Pick the goods via shipping company from their port/WH and bring into any FZ (with port like JAFZA) with your own Import Code. (Because you can't import into mainland with your Import Code) so hire a clearing agent, transfer ownership of goods to them, they inward the goods into mainland in their Import Code by paying custom duty & VAT etc.,, then transfer ownership of goods back to you & deliver the goods to your chosen WH/Fulfillment Centre. or **a2)** Let that shipping company pick the goods from origin itself as a shipper & consignee as well, bring the goods directly to mainland (by paying custom duty/VAT) to your chosen WH/FC and transfer the ownership of goods to your FZ company name (avoiding multiple charges/effort of transfer of ownership as in a1). It's said that many companies get fines at time of audit/inspection, because they sometime get the goods released from JAFZA/RAKEZ Port etc., (JAFZA/RAKEZ releases goods without you paying custom duty/VAT assuming the goods are going to another FZ, that is, where your company is hosted say Meydan FZ). If these goods are taken goods to WH/FC in mainland instead of your host FZ area and start selling, then it's liable to fines and bans. **b) Goods are Already in any of FZ area imported till FZ by some other company:** Need a similar arrangement as in a1, either that FZ company (or your FZ company if ownership transferred to you) need to hire clearing agent to bring goods into mainland by paying custom duty/VAT and deliver to your chosen WH/FC and transfer the ownership to your FZ company. **c) Goods are Already in Mainland** : **c1) Buying from Local Mainland Company Directly (can we?)** Simply issue order to local company and pay via your business bank/cheque and let them deliver to your chosen WH/FC. **(right?)** (does the ownership of goods transfer happen to you simply by executing this transaction of issuing PO/getting Invoice/delivery note or any other step involved?) **c2) Buying from Local FZ Company Directly (can we? goods are already in mainland)** Simply issue order to local company and pay via your business bank/cheque and let them deliver to your chosen WH/FC. **(right?)** (does the ownership of goods transfer happen to you simply by executing this transaction of issuing PO/getting Invoice/delivery note or any other step involved?) in both above cases (c1 & c2), how do you make sure that the goods you are buying from are custom duty & Import VAT already paid? **2) Buying from a local company in mainland and selling to another local company in mainland:** Simply issue order to 1st company and pay via your business bank/cheque and let them deliver (or arrange delivery company) to 2nd company after obtaining PO from & submitting Invoice to 2nd company **(right?)** (does the ownership of goods transfer happen to you from 1st company and then from you to 2nd company simply by executing these transactions of issuing PO/getting Invoice/delivery note or any other step involved?) How do you make sure that the goods you are buying from 1st company are custom duty & Import VAT already paid?

1ej3ysj,I miss the old Namshi,1ej3ysj,Marco_rital,"Anyone here miss the old Namshi ? (Before the Noon acquisition). Among all the UAE companies, Namshi used to be my favorite. They had covered everything a customer needs: - A great customer support with great transparency - Fast delivery times and return policy - A good selection of *authentic* products - A very user-friendly app Since Noon has acquired them, it all went downhill. The customer service has become very bad, the delivery time has increased and there is no longer transparency (some items are shipped without notification or delivered after the due date. Some of them are out of stock and can only be delivered after 2 weeks, while it appeared in stock upon ordering) The app is a disaster, it’s laggy with a lot of bugs and I hate browsing on it.

1gmczka,To my bike delivery (and a little to uber drivers) brothers,1gmczka,IcyMisses,"this is a message to all my bike delivery drivers ANYWHERE in the world let alone uae, please for your family, drive safely a couple of days ago i almost crashed into a noon food drive because i was ""driving too slow (90 in a 100 third lane)"" and he wanted to overtake me, and i almost fully crashed into him because the moment he tried overtaking me i went back to 3rd lane and sped up so i dont crash into him, almost got caught by the radar (doesnt matter im happy hes safe for what its worth) his turn was stupidly surprising and if i didnt notice and speed up wouldve 100% hit him one other time in the neighborhood a talabat bike was right behind me not giving me chance to breathe at all, i wanted to go left on an intersection and he took a left trying to stop me (yes it was obvious i had blinkers on) and i was forced to continue forward please guys, you're basically a person on a metal object going very fast, if i ignored him he wouldve hit me injuring himself and absolutely doing no damage to me and just doing damage that can be easily resolved by going to the garage while he has potential permanent damage and HE wouldve been wrong please for your family back home drive safely and dont let the company that may pension you for being late be the reason of you forever not seeing your family, put your life above your money yes i know people in roads disrespect alot of drivers ive seen it first hand but i wish to minimize the damage and a little rant to some uber/taxi drivers which i will forever despise until i die yesterday an uber driver kept not letting me take a left on the highway until we got close to a radar where he slowed down and sped up so i speed up and the radar catches me, i DID NOTHING to him and then saw him laugh at me from his window, thankfully i didnt get caught, but this happened NUMEROUS times its insane, i will forever hate and despise them and they genuinely taint my idea of ubers and taxis that i will see from now on and i hope they get what they deserve, i talked to the police numerous times ab some of the numbers of the cars and taxis that do it and they sometimes complete my scentence because they say they always get those complaints especially from uber drivers with fancier cars, respect yourselves respect to my humble and normal uber and taxi drivers tho",19,2024-11-08 11:17:49,True,True,post

Although I offered him some water and handed a can of barbican that I had available at the time, I still can't understand what just happened.

Two weeks ago, a friend of mine who was working as a delivery rider for Noon was involved in a fatal car accident in Dubai. The accident occurred while he was on duty. He was hired by a third-party company, not directly by Noon. Now, the company he was employed by is denying the insurance claim related to his death. They have stated that they will only cover the vehicle insurance and not any claims related to his death. This has left his family in a very difficult situation, both emotionally and financially. I am seeking advice on how to proceed with claiming his insurance. What steps can be taken to ensure his family receives the support they are entitled to? Are there specific legal avenues in Dubai that can be pursued in this case? Any guidance or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated.

1g7ul3t,Noon courier gave me back 17k AED 😯,1g7ul3t,Responsible-Dream867,"So I just moved to Dubai recently and I had 4 rough days of unpacking everything, shopping, setting up my desk, buying furniture etc. I was very exhausted. Decided to buy an electric scooter, found something nice on Noon app, for 1712 AED. Bought it, and when the courier delivered my scooter, I gave him 1712 AED + 38 AED tip (that is what I thought) Turned out I had 1000 AED bills instead of 100 AED bills and I gave him 17050 instead of 1750 AED, so 15300 more. I didnt notice that because I was so exhausted. Next day I was looking for the money and I was nearly sure I must have lost it, maybe it felt out of my pocket etc. I gave up after 2 hours of searching the apartment. We had 7 big suitcases when we were moving to Dubai and we stayed in a hotel for 2 weeks so it was a mess and I was sure I just lost the money somehow. Next day the courier messaged me on Whatsapp and he told me that I gave him 17k. It is unbelievable for me. I am from Poland, there is no way anybody would write me admitting he got so much money. I wasnt even thinking I gave him that amount, so he informed me all by himself. Incredible guys, I dont know if he was scared I would report him or he is so honest but when I meet him and wanted to give him 300 AED tip I needed to nearly force him to get this tip.

Who'd refuse such deal. That day, I decided I will delay ordering it till evening only to find out that the app was broken, it had technical difficulties and was crashing.I got soooo pissed then the next day, I open the app and it's working fine but I had a gut feeling to delay ordering it to see what this technical issues are all about. I checked their instagram to find that many people were complaining of the same issue. I submitted a request to their support team on two different emails but with no luck. Till today the issues are still there; it would work for few hours then it would be crashing most of the time. What's strange is that, regardless of this issues on their app AND website, they are still advertising through social media account. I also still see their ads everywhere and with crazy discount prices. Like this one for Nike shoes, it was 56% off and sometimes I see shoes ads for 1% which is also weird. So I'm genuinely asking does anybody knows what's wrong with Namshi app? Is it still working? Has anyone faced a similar experience and tried to order but they have recieved their order anyways?

Lately, almost every single order has been delayed (I don’t mind, I’m still getting it in under 30 minutes which is a blessing) but most of the time the driver marks it as “delivered” at the 12-13 minute mark, I’m assuming to avoid penalties. I know it’s a first world problem but it’s so annoying 😩 Sometimes I get a cool driver who will phone me to say he’s delayed and I tell him “don’t worry about it” But some drivers just lie and mark it as delivered 🤷🏻‍♀️ it’s annoying because I live in a huge complex and there have been occasions where my order has gone to the wrong tower. So when it says “delivered” I have to check that it’s there straight away. I go to my door, it’s not there, it’s already marked as delivered so I can no longer phone the driver to ask where he is, I contact support to ask where my order is, support sometimes gives me the driver’s number, I call him to ask, he says he’s on his way and begs me not to report him and now we’re all upset because I wasn’t going to report him, but just don’t lie 😭😭 Sorry, rant over!

While they were waiting, there was a drum of water that each one was taking from to quench their thirst. Not a water dispenser, just a blue drum. Not cold water, just a drum out in the open. It was a sad sight to see how hard these guys work, no matter all the rants of the way they drive, etc. Later in the day, I ordered some food, and saw these stats on Noon App. The rider to deliver my food had driven 263 kms delivering 32 orders, but just received 2 tips. That, imho, is another sorry state. The same app charges a service fee that we pay, but not the tip to a driver who rides in the heat? Is this an isolated case of a rider, or is tipping delivery riders just not a thing. Having been Dubai for long, tipping is definitely a norm though.

I was not at home as my wife had to go through an emergency c-section a day before so I gave the building security the key to let them keep it inside and install it. They sent a 60cm stove which did not fit the space obviously so instead of contacting me they left it *drumroll please* IN THE HALL IN FRONT OF THE TV. Once I got home, I contacted noon that their advertisement/product description was essentially wrong, which is why I ordered this product and therefore they need to arrange for return of this item. They said “ofcourse we are so sorry, this is a mistake on our part, we will fix it and someone will contact you for return”. They fixed the product description the same day, unfortunately I did not take a screenshot of the wrong ad as I thought it’s a straightforward issue that would be resolved as I was assured by the agent. Since then they keep saying “we sent the right item” essentially speaking like robots, repeating the same thing. Even a complain to DET hasn’t resulted in anything. It’s been 18 days without any solution.
